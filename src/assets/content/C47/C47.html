		Passing the Ticket
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So I guess you could say I was unnerved. &nbsp;Way unnerved.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		First, Dandy Boy yells at me for being a peasant who smacks his lips. &nbsp;Then my cover, my alibi, my ol&rsquo; pal Parp calls me up on the phone motivated by an insane compulsion to tell me &mdash; in-depth &mdash; why I am a dick. &nbsp;And this all happens just hours before I need to launch on a pair of fresh tits with brutal, bulgey man-pride.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		That was enough to undermine me. &nbsp;Plenty enough. &nbsp;But then Parp also lets on there is this regimen of penile calisthenics I was supposed to be doing. &nbsp;Well. &nbsp;In case you can&rsquo;t tell? &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t doing them. &nbsp;And I could no more fit them into the next few hours than I could fit in the year&rsquo;s-worth of push-ups and sit-ups and benches and squats that I also didn&rsquo;t do.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And on top of all that I smelled bad.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The boys and I were back at the apartment and I was in the shower feeling sorry for myself when it occurred to me that being completely unable to do anything about my geezer corpus was kind of lucky. &nbsp;No shit. &nbsp;I was a bullet now. &nbsp;A dead lump with a single trajectory into something soft and pink.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Well, there was one other conceivable trajectory. &nbsp;The one Parp suspected. &nbsp;On said trajectory I call Cammy up and make some cough cough cough sorry excuse for why Admiral Ballsy can&rsquo;t make the appointed appearance.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But that trajectory was <em>out</em>. &nbsp;If I took it, Admiral Ballsy would never let me live it down. &nbsp;Neither would Parp.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And it&rsquo;s not like Cammy met me online or something. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d seen me up close and for some reason she wanted what she thought I might have. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have to understand it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I started feeling pretty relieved. &nbsp;So while I was in the shower I reviewed in my head the strategy I had mapped out for the evening.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>First</em>&nbsp;I go in to tend bar.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Next</em>&nbsp;Parp comes by to give me his Roundabout Inn Gold Card &mdash; a.k.a., the &ldquo;fuck ticket&rdquo; &mdash; and splits quick. &nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Then</em>&nbsp;about an hour after Parp splits Cammy comes by to get said ticket so she can head up to the hotel and hang around watching porn in the room we reserved three days before (two adults, no kids, one night) until I get off my shift, which won&rsquo;t be until after midnight.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Then</em>&nbsp;at about nine I call up Corrinne to tell her I have to help Parp with some post-production deadline because he&rsquo;s my chum and there&rsquo;s no one else to help him and I probably won&rsquo;t get home until early next morning so I may as well just sleep at Parp&rsquo;s.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Then</em>&nbsp;I finish my shift and head over to screw Cammy till she cries.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was definitely not looking forward to Parp&rsquo;s involvement in this. &nbsp;After that phone call I got from him I was pretty sure he was going to show up and continue haranguing me. &nbsp;But he was pretty good. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t say a damn thing about Belinda, like the books on that subject were completely closed. &nbsp;He just sat at the bar drinking his ginger ale and then handed me the gold card/fuck ticket like we agreed.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When Cammy came in we did this routine where she was all &ldquo;Mr. Bartender sir could I please have a...&rdquo; and I was all &ldquo;We aim to please, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		It was like we were street mimes only using cryptic snatches of oral gush to further confuse the onlookers. &nbsp;And we fell right into it. &nbsp;No pre-planning or anything. &nbsp;We just had this great banter sympatico.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She said: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey barkeep, I think I was in here like a week ago? And left my eff ticket.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She giggled like a slut at the prom.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Was that like a business card on gold paper?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hey. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re cracking wise, low-life. &nbsp;Cut it out.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		There was this chunky Asian guy in a black jacket and tie with a drink in his hand watching us with this look on his face like he knew we had a secret and that he was sort of in on it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Right about then Arvo the bar manager walked in off the street and came over to us. &nbsp;Before I could actually grasp what was happening, this human sphincter artifact &mdash; who hadn&rsquo;t shaved or showered in a week &mdash; was standing next to me behind the bar, his stringy black hair just inches from my own head. &mdash; Easy leaping distance for lice.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;So who&rsquo;s dis?&rdquo; he grinned big. &nbsp;The yellow teeth weren&rsquo;t so bad. &nbsp;The two gray ones in the front though and the breath...like he just finished sucking a dumpster.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Arvo, this is Cameron, an actress friend of mine. &nbsp;Cameron, this is Arvo, the bar manager.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Actriss, huh?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Cammy tittered polite answers but you could see from her rictus grin that screaming horror lurked just beneath her face.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When he finally got tired of nauseating us and sludged his way back into the office, Cammy covered her mouth and nose with the neck of her t-shirt so she looked like a bandit and said: &ldquo;Holy fuckdick, is he wearing a diaper? &nbsp;Is it full?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Nahhh. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just that when he walks here from his house he likes to play in puddles of piss and he never changes his socks.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The Asian guy in the black jacket and tie overheard that and did one of those sputtery laughs through his lips. &nbsp;He put an unlit cigarette in his mouth and said, &ldquo;Watch drink please? &nbsp;I go smoke. &nbsp;B-R-B.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		He slid off the stool and was gone.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I gave Cammy the gold/fuck card/ticket and she skipped, but not before she looked at the name on it and said, &ldquo;Mr. Tony Parp, sir,&rdquo; half to herself. &nbsp;Then to me: &ldquo;So, what? &nbsp;Do I have to like forge his name or something to claim his frequent fucker miles?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Nope. &nbsp;He already called up so they know that you&rsquo;re his guest. &nbsp;Later on when I come up I&rsquo;m his other guest. &nbsp;He never has to show.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Roundabout Inn,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cool. &mdash; See ya.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; &nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Round about midnight.&rdquo; &nbsp;I gigcackled but she was gone.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		One last thing to do: &nbsp;call up &nbsp;Corrinne and sound all that-bastard-Parp-has-me-over-a-barrel-the-fucking-fuck-so-I-can&rsquo;t-come-home-to-the-ones-I-love.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Corrinne did not take it well. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me again why you&rsquo;re doing this?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I told her.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;But you know nothing about post-production.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Nobody else will help him with the voice-overs, babe.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Silence.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;You know how it is,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;The guy is lucky to have even one friend. &nbsp;You think anyone else on the planet would stand for this shit?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;He. &nbsp;Fucks. &nbsp;My. &nbsp;Friends.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She said it like she was resting her case.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;And then they dump him, right?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Silence, then: &nbsp;&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s paying you at least.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Not even that. &nbsp;This is what I get for being the producer.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Silence. &nbsp; And lots of it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Corrinne?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Good bye.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Click</em>&nbsp;is the noise that non-cellphones make or used to make back when I had one. &nbsp;Now of course I just stood there and said, &ldquo;Um, hon? &nbsp;You there?&rdquo; like a jackass.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She was going to be sore for the next few days but hey, Admiral Ballsy needed something wet and ridgy. &nbsp;And sometimes the Admiral gets what the Admiral needs.
