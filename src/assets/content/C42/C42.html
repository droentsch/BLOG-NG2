	<div class="chapterSubhead">The Egalitarian Card</div>
	<div class='body'>I pulled it off.&#160; It was great.&#160; I
		really got into the whole egalitarian thing.&#160; Like, &#8220;Hey
		Mike, don&#8217;t wanna lug that yourself?&#160; Let Uncle Paulie do
		it for ya.&#160; Therrrrrrre ya goooooooo.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I was avuncular.&#160; That&#8217;s the
		word.&#160; Like at lunch.&#160; The lunchbreak.&#160; Filmtards
		don&#8217;t like it when people split for lunch even in the middle of
		Manhattan where there&#8217;s an assload of restaurants right near
		everything and nobody has to drive anywhere.&#160; Getting you back is
		too chancy and their damn schedule is sacred so they usually have food
		brought in.&#160; Kurt Libby said that when he worked on one of
		Parp&#8217;s movies a few years ago Parp made the cast and crew go out
		to eat at the exact same restaurant a block from the set and they all
		marched there and back like a damn parade every day.</div>
	<div class='body'>At Vider&#8217;s this was a lot simpler since
		Vider&#8217;s is a club and they serve food anyway and even though it
		was closed that afternoon for the shoot and all the tables were shoved
		against one wall Vider opened up the kitchen and the chef came in and
		cracked wise while he cooked.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But here&#8217;s what I did, getting back to the point of me being
		appreciated for my awesome regularness: instead of sitting on the
		floor along the wall with the masters and creators &#8212; which I
		definitely could have done, being I&#8217;m a producer and I know all
		of them from way back &#8212; I sat on the floor along the <em>opposite
		</em>wall with the crewtards.&#160; &#8212; Except for the half-dozen or so
		crewtards who sat with the masters and creators.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>The traitors.</div>
	<div class='body'>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been
		cooler.&#160; They talked about the Knicks, I joined in.&#160; They
		told stupid jokes, I guffawed with my mouth open.&#160; I laughed with
		them, not at them.&#160; I went out of my way to tell this sniffly
		chick with zits like tits that I thought she had a really good
		point.&#160; And when it sounded a lot like I was criticizing
		Parp?&#160; I made sure I finished up by saying: &#8220;Ya know, he
		has a point of view too, and hey, he&#8217;s great don&#8217;tcha
		think?&#160; What a great guy.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I took a mouthful of spaghetti after saying
		that (oh yeah I was eating spaghetti) and I could sense them inching
		closer to me mentally.&#160; It was like I was this hip uncle who had
		taken them in after their square parents got killed in a car
		accident.&#160; Even Cammy who had been staring at me from the buffet
		table came over and sat next to me after telling the bearded boom
		operator to skootch over.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		It was right then that I started noticing it was a really great
		day.&#160; And I thought: &#8220;It <em>better</em> be great for the
		bucks I&#8217;m kicking in to be here.&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Then Vider came up to me and said,
		&#8220;Paul.&#160; Talk to&#160; Bobby about the next shot.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>He winked at me and walked into some back room.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Awright</em> , I&#8217;m thinking.&#160; <em>Me on camera!</em>&#160;
		But it turns out Whispers had other plans.&#160; Or maybe Vider
		wasn&#8217;t specific when he told Bobby the deal was I get to be in
		the next shot, because a few minutes later we were shooting again and
		I was standing just <em>off</em> camera holding a big piece of white
		cardboard next to Lenny Paine&#8217;s face to reflect light into the
		shadows made by the bags under his eyes.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>At first I was miffed and felt all back-knifed
		but it turned out it didn&#8217;t really matter.&#160; Cammy stood
		behind me during the shot and squeezed my butt-cheek once while the
		camera was rolling.</div>
	<div class='body'>On the next break we made the date.&#160; Yeah,
		not that night, but a definite date for Saturday night when we were
		all rested up and could ram like Ben Hur boats.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I did <em>not</em> gigcackle.&#160; And we all broke for home without
		Big Crap Cynthia showing up.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		A <em>great</em> day.
	</div>
