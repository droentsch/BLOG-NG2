	<div class="chapterSubhead">The Normal Male Curiosity</div>
	<div class='body'>See, that day I had to talk to the shrink
		pretty bad. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was my regular appointment day. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been known
		to blow those off but today I was desperate to talk and Carol
		Anne&rsquo;s loud mouth just made it worse. &nbsp;&nbsp;So at one o&rsquo;clock I
		was in Jessica&rsquo;s office blubbering for the sixteenth time about
		how my life was shattered beyond recognition when the wife announced
		she was going to spend the month of August chomping plank in L.A.</div>
	<div class='body'>And swear to God? &nbsp;&nbsp;When I finished puking
		self-pity into her ears and onto her desk and all over her rug she
		looked up at me and said: &ldquo;So how are you today Paul, not so
		good?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Like I&rsquo;d just spent the last ten minutes
		grunting and pointing!</div>
	<div class='body'>That kind of made me angry at her so then she
		had to sit there while I told her how shitty it was that she obviously
		wasn&rsquo;t listening to me.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Do you ever hear a word I say?!&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are
		you, you...you&rsquo;re like...you know what you&rsquo;re like?
		You&rsquo;re like the shrink in <em>Portnoy&rsquo;s Complaint</em> who
		waits till the end and then says &lsquo;so now vee may to
		begin?&rsquo;&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>She just sat there and took it, looking real
		concerned and saying she was sorry, she didn&rsquo;t mean for it to
		come out that way, until pretty soon I started to feel like a heel and
		sat down.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then we talked about what a sadist Junior is
		for calling up and rubbing my face in her infidelity every night under
		the pretense of wanting to speak to the boys.</div>
	<div class='body'>Finally Jessica said: &ldquo;Are you working on
		the book?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Is it helping?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Mostly,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I
		could really get it published, you know? &nbsp;&nbsp;Stick it to all of
		them.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;When did you last work on it?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Last night. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m working on it all
		the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an obsession now. &nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to
		do with myself if I didn&rsquo;t have the book to write.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So what did you write about last
		night?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the part where...Remember I told you about the
		second day we were shooting <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em> at
		Vider&rsquo;s and Parp made me go out to Long Island to pick up this
		big-assed Internet pornographer Belinda?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Right, Belinda. &nbsp;&nbsp;Remind me again, she was
		the cinematographer?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;No, the still photographer. &nbsp;&nbsp;You know.
		Behind the scenes, candid shots of cast and crew. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve ever
		gone out to LittleRoundJewishHat-dot-com you&rsquo;ve seen her
		work.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Do you think that has something to do
		with how you&rsquo;re feeling today?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah, I guess. &nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I guess it&rsquo;s not the <em>best</em>
		memory.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Would you like to tell me about
		it?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So I started telling her the Belinda/Hempstead story but I kind of
		free-associated and the next thing I knew I was flat on my back on the
		couch like a caricature from a <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;I started
		sobbing about how I didn&rsquo;t have a vagina to call my own and how
		I was afraid I might never get another one. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ever.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>And while I&rsquo;m lying there with my heart
		hanging out like a monkey-brain pi&ntilde;ata, Jessica says:
		&ldquo;Having a hard time meeting women?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I just looked at her. &nbsp;&nbsp;She looked back at me for
		a few seconds and then raised her right eyebrow as if to re-pose the
		question.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Do ya think?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
		mean I&rsquo;m a stinking bartender who&rsquo;s been laid off from his
		union job with two kids and a wife who&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s road
		fuck. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m a real catch.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a male model.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;And my last gig was modeling a metal finger up my nose!
		Meantime, I&rsquo;m watching on the news about Bobby Whispers and his
		damn tobacco that tastes like cunt and I&rsquo;m not a part of that,
		either. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was <em>this close</em> to being a part of that phenomenon,
		too, but I bailed because I couldn&rsquo;t stay focused.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Focused on...?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Focused on what I need to do...&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; I was just then
		sorting it out &mdash; &ldquo;...what I need to do <em>long-term</em>
		to attract ass.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t more to it?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she
		asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure you walked away from the tobacco project
		for the...that the only reason was that you lost focus on sex?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
		tobacco that tastes like cunt when you smoke it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I just wasn&rsquo;t
		that interested in it for itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me, it was about the chicks. &nbsp;&nbsp;I
		suppose if he made a tobacco that tasted like dick I&rsquo;d at least
		have to smoke some to settle the longstanding male curiosity. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Straight</em>
		male curiosity, I mean.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;The taste of dick.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was
		this long pause while she looked at me with this really exaggerated
		poker face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with that. &nbsp;&nbsp;You find you&rsquo;re
		curious about the taste of penis?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Suddenly it sounded wrong.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make a federal case out
		of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m no more curious than the next guy.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Another long
		pause.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with this
		&lsquo;huh&rsquo;? &nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re a therapist for Christ&rsquo;s sake.
		You never heard about male dick-taste curiosity?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she trailed off and sat
		back in her chair. &nbsp;&nbsp;She put a pen in her mouth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she
		said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, how far does this curiosity go with you? &nbsp;&nbsp;I
		don&rsquo;t remember seeing anything about it in Dr. Selsa&rsquo;s
		notes, or Dr. Koch&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s
		nothing to put down. &nbsp;&nbsp;I know it came up but Koch told me not to worry
		about it because every man is curious about the taste of dick.
		It&rsquo;s a Freudian thing.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Dr. &nbsp;&nbsp;Koch said that?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;&nbsp;What, you&rsquo;re saying he made
		it up? &nbsp;&nbsp;Because I&rsquo;m telling you I&rsquo;m not a queer. &nbsp;&nbsp;I
		don&rsquo;t actually want to suck on a dick. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not even
		slightly gay.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she said.
		&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that you are. &nbsp;&nbsp;But you know, sexual
		identity ...&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;She cut herself off and then said: &ldquo;No, no,
		no, it&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was just thinking that there
		are a lot of theories about sexual identity that are a little
		strait-jacketing. &nbsp;&nbsp;You know, some people &mdash; and I think
		they&rsquo;re wrong about this &mdash; some people want to say that if
		you ever think about a member of your own sex then that makes you gay,
		and if you don&rsquo;t accept yourself as gay then you&rsquo;re
		repressing, and I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true. &nbsp;&nbsp;At
		least, it isn&rsquo;t necessary for you to believe that, Paul.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>What a relief.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It seems...&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she said,
		&ldquo;...well, I believe I know what you&rsquo;re saying, that some
		men want to taste other men&rsquo;s penises &mdash;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to taste another man&rsquo;s penis,
		I&rsquo;m just&mdash;&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I took a breath &ldquo;&mdash;I just have
		the <em>normal male curiosity</em> about what dick tastes like!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Have you ever tried to taste your own
		penis?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bend over that far.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She tapped her pen against her teeth.
		&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you should consider
		the point of view that even if you did want to taste another
		man&rsquo;s penis it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily make you gay. &nbsp;&nbsp;It just
		makes you a man that wants to taste a penis. &nbsp;&nbsp;And right now
		you&rsquo;re not even that. &nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re just a man who has a
		curiosity about it.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I didn&rsquo;t feel mollified, consoled,
		cajoled, or whatever she was trying to make me feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was shocked,
		perturbed, and disnoyed. &nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I thought this was a settled issue.
		Any of you chicks reading this may have to take my word for it but
		hey, guys, you know what I&rsquo;m saying.</div>
	<div class='body'>Right?</div>
