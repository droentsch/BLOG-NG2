	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Daddy&hellip;&rdquo; she said, and like I said it was this little person&rsquo;s voice, a child&rsquo;s, and really well-mimicked. &nbsp;If I&rsquo;d been listening to her voice on tape I&rsquo;d have sworn she was eleven years old. &nbsp;&ldquo;Daddy, will you rub my little butt for me please?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was close enough, so she sat back on her heels and squeezed my cock through my pants. &nbsp;It squished like pastry.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I chuckled kind of nervous. &nbsp;&ldquo;Stage fright,&rdquo; I said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;My cock. &nbsp;Opening night jitters.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She threw her arms around my neck and murmurred in my ear in that childish voice: &ldquo;What do you mean, Daddy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;First night nerves. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll go away. &nbsp;Honest.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Well, why would you come to my room if I scare you, <em>Daddy?</em>&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And on that &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; she kind of lost her little-person voice and instead she sounded like a miffed grown-up.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>I get it</em>, I thought. &nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m Daddy. &nbsp;And Daddy doesn&rsquo;t break character</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Well, Daddy isn&rsquo;t afraid of <em>you</em>, baby.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She kissed my neck and pushed back and looked in my eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you scared of my mommy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;A little?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She gasped. &nbsp;&ldquo;Does she know you like to fuck little boys?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Something inside my skull screamed: <em>Are you fucking kidding me?!</em> &nbsp;But in the outside world I just stared at her. &nbsp;I was calm, like my brain and face were separated by a circuit-breaker.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She grinned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad, Daddy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m just a little boy.&rdquo; &nbsp;She grinned bigger. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who sucks cock.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		For a minute I thought she might be yanking my chain. &nbsp;You know, because I have two boys. &nbsp;Then it occurred to me for a second that this would be Parp&rsquo;s idea of a fantastic joke. &nbsp;Could she have set this up with Parp? &nbsp;Holy shit&hellip;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But then she hugged me around the neck again and I could feel her wet mouth giving it hot little sucks. &nbsp;She seemed too into it for a practical joke, and I kind of gave myself shit mentally for being so paranoid.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, Daddy. &nbsp;Mommy&rsquo;s gone aaaaallllll night. &nbsp;Come up here and cuddle me, Daddy.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She crawled up on her knees to the head of the bed and pulled me up to follow her.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She stretched out. &nbsp;I stretched out. &nbsp;She kicked off her shiny black shoes. &nbsp;I kicked off my big fat man-shoes.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		They clunked to the floor.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She put her head on my shoulder and hugged me across the chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad Mommy&rsquo;s out of the way,&rdquo; she sighed.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She got up on one elbow and gave me this really deep, wet kiss with no tongue.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She lay back down and hugged me in a tight clench and buried her face in my neck.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Maybe it&rsquo;s obvious from the ellipsis, but she was <em>prompting</em> me.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes&hellip; Billy?&rdquo; I ventured.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Do you love me more than Mommy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I gave her a squeeze. &nbsp;Just like a Daddy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, honey. &nbsp;Billy. &nbsp;I do. &nbsp;I love you way more than Mommy.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I know why Mommy doesn&rsquo;t want us to be alone.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Mm-hmmm. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s all afraid you&rsquo;re going to make me suck your cock.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She got up on her elbow again and looked down at my face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you going to do that, Daddy? &nbsp;Are you going to make me suck your cock?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes what?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to make you blow me&hellip;&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll spank you.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She got all scared. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t spank me, Daddy!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Then eat your Daddy&rsquo;s dick, Billy-boy.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She unbuckled my pants and put her head down on that place where my abs would be if I had any. &nbsp;I could see her arched back curve to the ass crack and down into her little dress pants with the black leather belt.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And my cock was like a dachsund that just saw its first greyhound. &nbsp;<em>Holy fuck</em>, I thought. &nbsp;<em>It&rsquo;s getting smaller</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;What up, Daddy?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;tcha wanna come in my mouuuuutttthhhhh?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; &nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Daddy needs a drink.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I got up and hooked my pants together to keep them from falling back down around my ankles and walked across the room and got one of the little bottles out of the refrigerator.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Makers Mark. &nbsp;Classy. &nbsp;Like I said? &nbsp;The Roundabout Inn is not a dive.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I raised the bottle to her in the universal sign for &ldquo;want some?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She just stared at me so I wiggled it at her in case she didn&rsquo;t understand the universal sign.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Why do you want me to drink, Daddy?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;She looked at me slightly wide-eyed, with an uncoordinated tilt to her head, like she really was ten years old. &nbsp;Like she&rsquo;d been rehearsing the character and getting feedback in some class.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I may have shivered. &nbsp;This DeNiro shit was giving me the willies.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;What will Mommy think if I&rsquo;m all drunk?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She said it like she was chastising me. &mdash; And she was! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like the postits on the door said: <em>don&rsquo;t break character</em>. &nbsp;&mdash; And I&rsquo;d been breaking character every few minutes since we started.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So I resolved not to do that any more. &nbsp;I was &mdash; am &mdash; an actor, and I can method with the best of them.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I reached down and made that mental fist. &nbsp;I was Daddy.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I gulped down the contents of the little Maker&rsquo;s Mark bottle and put the empty next to the plasma TV on the bureau on the wall facing the bed. &nbsp;Then I slowly &mdash; with the deliberation of a grown-up &mdash; walked around to the side of the bed where she was sitting.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Come over to the edge of the bed and sit right in front of the Dadster,&rdquo; I said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She did. &nbsp;She squared off so she was staring straight into my shirt buttons with her shoeless feet touching the floor.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Now you eat Daddy&rsquo;s plank,&rdquo; I said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She smiled and looked up at me.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I gave her a stern look. &nbsp;&ldquo;You want Daddy to love you, don&rsquo;t you Billy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Oh yes, Daddy!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Then you need to show Daddy how much you love the taste of dick.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She did that little gigchuckle of hers as she undid my pants again.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		A part of me would like to describe the ensuing blowjob in detail? &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not here to get you off. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m here to get revenge and justice.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		In case you forgot.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But I would like to say at this juncture that Cammy&hellip; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like she was born with a dick in her mouth. &nbsp;And you boys out there, you might want to consider this when you&rsquo;re sizing up a babe for what&rsquo;s important. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice to be with a smart girl or a girl with principles and whatnot, but take it from your Uncle Paulie, it&rsquo;s <em>really</em>&nbsp;nice to be with a girl who&rsquo;s had a whole bunch of cocks in her face. &nbsp;Really <em>nice</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When she finished me off she gave me another one of those gigchuckles, tortured my swollen balls with her tongue for a few seconds, then crawled off and pulled me down next to her and gave me a great big smooch.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		That was when I had my summer-breeze-in-Hawaii moment. &nbsp;Life was good.
