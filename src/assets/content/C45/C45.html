	<div class="chapterSubhead">Dandy Boy</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tend bar at George
		Vider&rsquo;s nightclub?&rdquo; Junior asked. &nbsp;She slapped a
		plate down in the draining tray and picked up a dish-towel and dried
		her hands fast and turned around to face me.</div>

	<div class='body'>I knew it was an important question because she
		stood there for a few seconds and didn&rsquo;t take her eyes off me.
		&nbsp;And...it&rsquo;s kind of a sore spot, because I know people are
		wondering why I don&rsquo;t hang at Vider&rsquo;s with the show-biz
		pharisees.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the bartenders are
		unionized at Vider&rsquo;s club, sweetie ...&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope. &nbsp;Those guys are lucky if they
		make two hundred bucks a night including tips.&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>She sighed.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Local Six all the way!&rdquo; I
		gigcackled.</div>

	<div class='body'>She sighed again. &nbsp;&ldquo;But
		wouldn&rsquo;t you make contacts there? &nbsp;I mean &mdash;&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>Another sigh &mdash;</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;&mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for
		your career? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t agents go there? &nbsp;Comics?
		&nbsp;Singers? &nbsp;Actors? &nbsp;It just seems like you have the
		perfect dayjob for networking and instead you spend all night in that
		midtown hotel with salesmen and tourists.&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;And hookers,&rdquo; I gigcackled.
		&nbsp;Like the tall one at my bar every night in the boots with the
		seven-inch heels and the leather pants.</div>

	<div class='body'>Junior stared at me. &nbsp;She was unfazed.
		&nbsp;She really couldn&rsquo;t figure me out. &nbsp;Was I really into
		this being-an-artist crap or wasn&rsquo;t I?</div>

	<div class='body'><em>Okay</em>, I thought while she stared at me, <em>my bad</em>.
		&nbsp;See, for the past five days I&rsquo;d been haranguing her with
		anecdotes of my three days producin&rsquo; the music video. &nbsp;I
		wanted her to think the reason I was all chipper and whistling and
		happy all the time wasn&rsquo;t because I was about to start pounding
		the fresh tail of a thirty-something actress who had once killed as
		Luise Miller in <em>Kabale und Liebe</em>, but because my career was moving.
		&nbsp;Because I was meeting people. &nbsp;Because the biz-bug had
		re-bitten me. &nbsp;Now, by asking me why I wasn&rsquo;t interested in
		tending Vider&rsquo;s show-biz bar, she was kind of calling my bluff.</div>

	<div class='body'>Huh. &nbsp;You know I don&rsquo;t think I ever
		realized it until just this second typing it out but that&rsquo;s
		exactly what she was doing: calling my bluff.</div>

	<div class='body'>The hypocritical slit.</div>

	<div class='body'>Why hypocritical, you ask? &nbsp;Bear this in
		mind whenever I mention Junior and her domestic complaints: <em>at no time
		was she supposed to be the full-time housewife and mommy in this
		arrangement</em>.</div>

	<div class='body'>She started out as an actress, for
		Christ&rsquo;s sake. &nbsp;Now she was a full-time drudge! &nbsp;She
		was as lost in the middle-class maze as I was and putting in even less
		effort to get out. &nbsp;When was the last time she&nbsp;produced
		&mdash; even pretend produced &mdash; a music video? &nbsp;Not to
		mention a music video that ended up cyber-sweeping the nation?</div>

	<div class='body'>Hey, and if she&rsquo;d wanted to do that?
		&nbsp;I would have so&nbsp;supported the twat.</div>

	<div class='body'>But back last March, in my kitchen when we were
		having this conversation? &nbsp;No way I had that in my head.
		&nbsp;Back then all I wanted from her was to let me off the hook for
		not asking Vider if I could serve drinks to twenty-something
		&ldquo;comics&rdquo; in his club.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hon &ndash; eyyyyyyyy ...&rdquo; I
		whine-pled. &nbsp;I walked up to her from behind and wrapped my
		lovin&rsquo; arms around her waist. &nbsp;&ldquo;One step at a time.
		&nbsp;Today: music video producer. &nbsp;Tomorrow: tending bar in a
		nightclub maybe.&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>I gigcackled to underline the irony in case she
		missed it.</div>

	<div class='body'>She didn&rsquo;t say anything.
		&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge I was there. &nbsp;I kissed her
		neck. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;Just kept rinsing her dishes. &nbsp;</div>

	<div class='body'>So I detached myself and whistled down the
		hallway to get the boys who were in their room and up to no good on
		the Internet.</div>

	<div class='body'><em>Fuck it</em>, I thought at the wife. &nbsp;<em>Be pissed
		off. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take my dick business to a dick aficionado</em>.</div>

	<div class='body'>But I had a whole day ahead of me before I had
		to worry about anything erection-esque. &nbsp;And right now the
		mission was: take the boys to Riverside Park for a day of Man-Squad
		fun.</div>

	<div class='body'>If you&rsquo;re from New York you maybe
		remember last March. &nbsp;We had these two weeks at the end of the
		month that were ridiculously warm, remember? &nbsp;The arms were
		already starting to come out. &nbsp;<em>Give it another six weeks</em>, I
		thought, <em>and we&rsquo;ll start seeing naked legs on rollerblades and
		single mommies with tight glutes in tight sweats</em>.</div>

	<div class='body'>So I had the boys and they had their plastic
		light-sabers and we were on our way to the playland that is Riverside
		Park.</div>

	<div class='body'>When we got there we immediately went to the
		lunchcart of the nice immigrant man selling shishkabob.</div>

	<div class='body'>The Man Squad <em>runs</em>&nbsp;on shishkabob.</div>

	<div class='body'>Then we ran over and sat down on a bench next
		to this dandy boy in a white ringer tee under a white jacket with
		black trim that looked like he maybe stole it from a waiter in a
		classy restaurant. &nbsp;He also had on these brown suede chick-boots
		and flaming yellow pants.</div>

	<div class='body'>Now, I&rsquo;m a liberal. &nbsp;When I see fags
		roving around on the Upper West Side my first impulse is to walk over
		to them and say, &ldquo;Thank you for bringing some diversity to my
		neighborhood.&rdquo; &nbsp;I know that some guys get all defensive
		about the park being a family place where their kids are protected and
		what not, but what I say to those guys is: live and let live or go
		fuck yourself.</div>

	<div class='body'>Am I right?</div>

	<div class='body'>So me and the boys didn&rsquo;t think twice
		about sitting down next to a dandy boy and chowing down shishkabob
		like we were made of wolf parts.</div>

	<div class='body'>I&rsquo;m going to be completely honest here
		and admit we were kind of messy. &nbsp;But we were eating street meat
		for fuck sake! &nbsp;And all we had to wipe up with were these flimsy
		white paper napkins like the ones from the metal dispenser in a diner
		and I guess the odor from the meat was pretty, well, <em>odory</em>.</div>

	<div class='body'>Then the boys, well...I don&rsquo;t know what
		the boys did first. &nbsp;I think Harry farted and then we started
		making fart jokes, or maybe it was the other way around.
		&nbsp;It&rsquo;s kind of jumbled in my head. &nbsp;I settled them down
		and we started just chewing. &nbsp;Then Harry put a pepper in his nose
		and said, &ldquo;Boooooooooooggggerrrrrrrrrrrr...&rdquo; like Count
		Dracula, and I gigcackled.</div>

	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s when the dandy boy jumps up
		&ndash; swear to God he&rsquo;s been sitting still as a statue so I
		forgot he was even there &ndash; and screams at me in this metrosexual
		accent: &nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus <em>Christ</em>, you lip-smacking peasant!
		&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t you have <em>any</em>&nbsp;awareness of the people around
		you?! &nbsp;Well?!&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>And he stared at me with these eyes popping
		from the adrenaline. &nbsp;His nostrils weren&rsquo;t flared but he
		was panting a little and he was all brown like a Cuban or a Puerto
		Rican or an Arab or something.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sorry ...&rdquo; I said.</div>

	<div class='body'>He turned around and pranced away. &nbsp;He
		looked funny, his little fag boots pounding the wet earth as he
		stomped up the path to Riverside Drive.</div>

	<div class='body'>At first I was really sorry like I said to the
		guy but then I thought, <em>fuck you, dandy boy</em>.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo; Sam said. &nbsp;I looked
		down. &nbsp;He was looking up at me all scared and confused like a
		puppy that just got his nose slapped. &nbsp;I had a good mind to call
		a cop, except there&rsquo;s no law against scaring kids by screaming
		at their dad.</div>

	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, boys,&rdquo; I said.
		&nbsp;&ldquo;That man is just upset because he can&rsquo;t afford an
		iPod like everybody else.&rdquo;</div>

	<div class='body'>The assqueer. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t like the
		sounds and smells of my family? &nbsp;Buy some earbuds and a burrito
		like the rest of civilization and get your fanny huggers out of my
		face!</div>

	<div class='body'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		looked at my shivering kids and I knew I was right.</div>
