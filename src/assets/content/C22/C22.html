        The Problem With Party Girls
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        After Parp&rsquo;s hissy fit in the bar I
        finished my St.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauli Girl and ordered another.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn&rsquo;t
        want to go home to the world of wife, kids, and no chance for fresh
        snatch.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I just.&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanna.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I was savoring my freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I think of
        it, I don&rsquo;t think the word &ldquo;savoring&rdquo; has enough
        tension in it to describe what was making my hands shake.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted
        fresh snatch, and hanging there alone in a midtown bar meant that
        technically I still had a shot at it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But nothing happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even chat
        with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday night but still too early for any real
        action.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had a bus to catch.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I walked uptown and west a few blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        didn&rsquo;t want to take the chance that anyone in my new world
        would see me getting on a bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; And when it came I got on
        fast.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It was crowded but nobody bugged me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked out
        the window in this way that&rsquo;s a universal sign to New Yorkers
        that you&rsquo;re not available for chatting.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know.
        You&rsquo;re not really seeing the sights or anything but
        you&rsquo;re in your own world and you&rsquo;d like to keep it that
        way.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Usually New Yorkers respect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
        every now and then you get some urban Andy of Mayberry who thinks
        mass transit is a hayride and everybody&rsquo;s there to say howdy
        and eat salami in front of strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;New Yorkers have a code-word
        to identify a person like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;That code-word is:
        &nbsp;<em>asshole</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        There weren&rsquo;t any assholes riding with me
        that night so I got to have my thoughts all to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly my
        brain was just this gigantic support system for my cock, feeding me
        fresh images of Cammy bent over with my cock in her cunt-lips,
        Cammy on her knees with my dick in her mouth, Cammy trembling a
        little while I rubbed the hot lube into her asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cammy...you
        get the picture.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        (Sorry if that montage lacks poetry, ladies, but
        in case you didn&rsquo;t know it already there are no pictures of
        sunsets in the male libido.)
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But even in that condition &mdash; and I guess
        you could call it &ldquo;fevered&rdquo; &mdash; I knew that I had
        to get my head back into Junior world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior&rsquo;d spent the day
        at Chuck E.&nbsp;Cheese with the boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;d done it the whole
        time resenting me and wishing she was off with Sue Gasparino
        traipsing around town and complaining about the male monopoly on
        penises.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So Junior was going to be pissed.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I was
        all head-in-the-clouds over some chick who wants me to see her with
        her pants off, well, Junior had radar for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe all chicks
        do, what do I know?&nbsp;&nbsp;But once l let Junior get a whiff of it
        she&rsquo;d be on me till I confessed to something believable that
        she could get on the phone and cry to her old man about.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Keeping her in the dark meant I would have to be
        real careful about making sure I gave her all of the details about
        the day except for the details humming with fuck-noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided
        that I would make my encounter with Bang Springfield larger.
        &ldquo;Gee, Hon, I met this really funny guy!&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a stand-up
        comic at Vider&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Et cetera.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I was also thinking about those last few seconds
        with Cammy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t sure we parted on the highest note we
        could have.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s because she didn&rsquo;t laugh when
        I said that thing about me being able to picture Parp with a big,
        black dick in his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, she didn&rsquo;t laugh at
        &nbsp;<em>all</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even politely.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was she thinking?&nbsp;&nbsp;She
        pretty much split right after I said that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she think I was a
        racist or something?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And then there was Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to have to
        call him up tonight and be all self-deprecating and pretending
        I&rsquo;m sorry I offended him by asking him for a friendly favor
        that didn&rsquo;t cost him anything.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I really hate that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretending to be all
        chastened, like a dog smashed on the nose with a rolled-up
        newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had to do it because I didn&rsquo;t have any other
        way of getting to see Cammy the next day, and I was pretty sure if
        I could see her then we could at least work a blowjob into it.
        Maybe I could even get her to bend over in a bathroom stall or
        something.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And no, I couldn&rsquo;t just leave it up to
        contacting her at her number or email on the contacts list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I
        told Parp: I couldn&rsquo;t have her thinking that I was thinking about her
        this much after encountering her for what, a half hour?&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-five
        minutes?&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted her to think I could get ass any time I wanted it
        but because I&rsquo;d taken this shine to her I&rsquo;d be willing
        to work her into the rotation.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And I also knew there was a chance that Cammy was
        just bluing my balls for the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, to feed her own
        ego.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicks do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t want to
        actually &nbsp;<em>get</em>
        fucked, they just want to know they
        &nbsp;<em>could</em>
        get fucked so they&rsquo;ll have more confidence the
        next time they get in a fight with the boyfriend or so they can
        come harder when they masturbate.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I&rsquo;m not saying all chicks do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
        I&rsquo;m definitely saying most chicks do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You chicks?&nbsp;&nbsp;You know
        you&rsquo;re busted.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I&rsquo;m right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t write
        your little exclamation marks in the margin, just move along.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Once, about twenty-five years ago, I spent the summer
        in the Berkshires acting at this place called the Lost Rustics
        Summer Theatre and there was this chick with a cock-eater grin and
        a tight little athlete&rsquo;s ass and this short kind of page-boy
        hair so you could really see yourself sucking the back of her neck
        and she was flirting with me man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I was going to pop in
        my pants she was word-fucking me so hard.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But I had to go back home to the other side of
        Massachusetts for two days before we could get anything done
        sex-wise.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to finish painting my mom&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you
        think I was pissed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still in
        college and my mom said she'd let me have her car for the summer if I finished painting
        her house, and that was a pretty good deal.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But getting on into the second day I was sitting
        there on ladder with white primer all over my pants and all I could
        think about was how I had this babe in the Berkshires all primed
        for a pound.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was agony.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went back without actually
        finishing my mom&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did most of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I did the
        most important part, the part people could see from the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
        I split early in the morning on day three while my mom was still in
        bed snoozing.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Yeah, she was disappointed and it was a pretty
        shitty thing to do but I was young and there was a cunt with my
        name on it so I got in my mom&rsquo;s car and drove.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        When I got back to the Berkshires I was looking
        for her and thinking about this fantastic summer of fuck I was in
        for when she comes stumbling out of this dorm (the theatre was on
        the campus of some little college closed for the summer) drunk at
        like eleven in the morning with her arm around the waist of this
        fat fuck with a little goatee and a t-shirt with the word
        &ldquo;Alcoholic&rdquo; written on it next to a picture of a
        cross-eyed guy with a wacky grin.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I&rsquo;m watching this and I&rsquo;m thinking,
        &ldquo;Party-girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like a party girl.&rdquo; I was pretty sure
        she didn&rsquo;t hook up with this guy for the whole summer and,
        well, she&nbsp;<em>had</em>
        to have been thinking about me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
        &nbsp;<em>met</em>
        me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned her on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t pay attention to
        her for a couple days but hey, now I was back.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So she walks past me with this guy and I&rsquo;m
        like smiling at her and she&rsquo;s laughing her ass off till she
        gets right up to me and then she looks at me looking at her and she
        sees me smiling and she says, &ldquo;What are &nbsp;<em>you</em>
        so happy
        about?&rdquo; and she and this guy laugh like they&rsquo;re sidekicks
        in a road movie and they just keep walking past.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So I felt the usual trifecta of emotions:
        stupidity for sneaking out of my mom&rsquo;s house and driving for
        hours with ass on the brain, blue-balled disappointment at the
        sudden evaporation of said ass, and anger at the twat for being so
        stupid about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, I wanted to find her and argue with her
        about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>me</em>, babe.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll ball ya
        long and strong.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It was before I started seeing a shrink so I
        didn&rsquo;t know about my problem yet.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        A couple days later one of the wealthy locals who
        was the main contributor to the summer theatre threw this big party
        at her house.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was this forty-five year-old divorced chick who
        every summer had a new harem of twenty and thirty-something men she
        tried to seduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pretty frustrated that summer because
        look, she was dumpy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-five can be hot if you stay on the
        treadmill and do your squats and lunges but dumpy forty-five is
        like banging your aunt.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Anyway, so this rich, dumpy, forty-five year-old
        slut wannabe throws this party and we all go.&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the time I get
        there my would-be summer babe is already there and all drunk again
        and I notice that she and these other actresses are standing around
        in the kitchen part of the party area and they&rsquo;re like
        laughing to each other whenever I get like, close, and then this
        one time when I go up to the fridge for a screwed julius
        (it&rsquo;s an orange julius with vodka, kids) she gets all silent
        and then she mutters something I can&rsquo;t hear and they all
        start giggling.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I kind of skulked away.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this guy &mdash; the
        guy she was fucking a few days before, the fat fuck with the goatee
        &mdash;now he&rsquo;s pissed at her for fucking some &nbsp;<em>other</em>
        guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;So he sees me skulk away and he tells me to get some balls and
        go over and confront her.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I liked that guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&rsquo;t remember his name
        but after I realized she&rsquo;d fucked him over too?&nbsp;&nbsp;We had kind
        of a sympatico going.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Anyway, I took his advice and walked over and
        said, &ldquo;What up, Moira?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name was Moira.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny how that shit
        comes back to you.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a crush
        on you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And I said, &ldquo;Shit, ya
        don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have crush on
        you so stop acting like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay?&nbsp;&nbsp;You can stop acting like you
        think I want to fuck you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the chicks got
        really quiet, like they were waiting to see what I would come back
        with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I did the worst possible thing I could do to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right
        when everyone was waiting for me to crack snide, I played the
        mature card.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh, shit, babe,&rdquo; I said with a voice
        all low and adult.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t mean to make you
        feel uncomfortable tonight.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        There were a couple giggles from the onlooking
        babes but they stopped fast when I didn&rsquo;t crack a smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        just stared at Moira, caring.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she kind
        of jerked herself away from the counter she was leaning on and
        stumbled away into another part of the party.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh shit,&rdquo; I sighed, sort of to
        myself, like I really did give a gnat&rsquo;s thick crank about her
        feelings.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; one of
        the other chicks &mdash; Rita &mdash; said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been
        fucked up since last Wednesday.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That night I fucked Rita and pretty much had her
        for the whole summer.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So on the bus ride home from day one of shooting
        &nbsp;<em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        I knew, even though I really
        wanted to screw the brains out of this Cammy chick, I knew there
        was a good chance she was just going to flake on me the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s never good as a rule to give a chick a
        night to think about it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;That guy who told me to go confront
        Moira that night?&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy with the little goatee?&nbsp;&nbsp;I just remembered
        his name was Chet.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn&rsquo;t for him I might have ended up being
        just this joke that chicks laughed at all summer and I probably never would
        have nailed Rita.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So Chet, if you&rsquo;re reading this?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Thanks
            dude!</em>
    </div>
</div>
