        Little Round Jewish Hat
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Back to the black box theatre at midtown and that 
        first day of shooting <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Bang &ndash; that&rsquo;s Bangalore Springfield, 
        the <em>faux</em>-Indian stand-up comic who asked me about Libby
        and Parp &ndash; decided he needed the eyebrow lining after all and
        went to find makeup babe.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I went and got some more coffee from one of the
        coffee boxes on the donut table and stared at the pretty, dark
        stand-in under the light that Parp was focusing.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        You remember the stand-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who
        said she thought Oprah was a frigid
        twat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a babe.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
        was sitting on an aluminum chair with her legs straddling the
        back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the back wasn&rsquo;t solid, it was like a
        frame with thin, metal slats so you could see through to the tight
        jeans over her spread legs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was staring at the thin
        layer of denim over her cunt and she caught on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a
        smile from her but I didn&rsquo;t do anything.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Fuck me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot all about that until
        just now writing it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at the beginning of a
        flirt with this babe and then stuff happened and I&rsquo;m just
        remembering this loose string now, five months later.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        (I bet I could&rsquo;ve balled her.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
        I can find the contact sheet I bet I still can.)
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Right then all I could think about was how great
        it was to be in that theatre instead of in square
        world.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in a place where I could glance at a cunt
        and get caught by the owner of said cunt and have her smile instead
        of start screaming like I raped her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
        safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was home.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        <em>And I had to beat a bitch just so I could
            spend the day here instead of at Chuck E.&nbsp;Cheese,</em>
        I
        thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Somebody give me a gun so I can blow out my
            fucking brains.</em>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We were all sweating.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was March and
        getting toward April so it wasn&rsquo;t what you would call
        &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in New York, but the lights were pretty intense
        in that small space so somebody&rsquo;d clicked on the air
        conditioner and makeup babe did another round of touch-ups on the
        actors.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So okay one thing I&rsquo;ve always wanted
        to ask you libertarians is this,&rdquo; Lenny Paine called up to
        Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had navigated back to where I was standing with
        Bang only now Lenny was standing next to me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;How do you defend countries like Guatemala
        and El Salvador?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp didn&rsquo;t say anything for a long time,
        just kept playing with this big light aiming it down at the sweet
        snatch in the aluminum chair, then finally he said: &ldquo;I
        don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey Lenny,&rdquo; said
        Bobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about ready for you and
        Theresa so why don&rsquo;t you do something like get into
        character.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Dude, I <em>am</em>
        my
        character.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That&rsquo;s where I tuned out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby
        was coming down the ladder to have a conversation with Lenny, Parp
        was still screwing with the lights, I was trying to figure out the
        connection between libertarians and El Salvador. I mean,
        libertarians are nature&rsquo;s nutjobs, but I don&rsquo;t think
        they&rsquo;re in charge of any countries that I know of.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And if there are any libertarians reading this,
        sorry about calling you nature&rsquo;s nutjobs &ndash; especially
        you libertarians not getting blowjobs from my wife, except you know
        it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, heroin should be for sale at
        Wal-Mart?&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t heroin be for
        sale?&rdquo; Parp asked me once.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Um, because, it eats the
        brain?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You mean like gin?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That&rsquo;s pretty much the gist of any
        conversation with a libertarian.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to just smile
        and ride it out and have the real conversations with people who
        know that gin is not heroin.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So do you believe in legalizing
        marijuana?&rdquo; Parp asked once.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I
        said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Medical</em>
        marijuana, why
        not?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between
        medical marijuana and regular marijuana?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
        doctor says you can have it?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why should it be illegal to buy drugs
        unless you pay a state-licensed doctor to write it down on a piece
        of paper from the magic pad?&rdquo; asked
        Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you want to see a doctor first, okay,
        nobody&rsquo;s stopping you, but why should you have cops on your
        doorstep if you want to buy drugs without getting a permission slip
        first?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s fucking dangerous shit
        out there!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not everybody thinks
        first, they have to have a brake on them before they do something
        dangerous.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Ya know what&rsquo;s dangerous?&rdquo;
        Parp asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Trusting doctors because they have
        the magic pad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ask Heath Ledger and Michael
        Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, you can&rsquo;t ask
        them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ya know why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Their doctors killed
            them.</em>
        &rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Fuck it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Libertarians.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
        doctor killed Michael Jackson so now let&rsquo;s put the cocaine
        back in Coca-Cola.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So even though Lenny was pretty wrong about
        Guatemala and El Salvador, at least he knew that Parp was kind of a
        laughingstock.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to admire that.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        After Bobby got down to talk to Lenny, he called
        over Theresa to have a chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s Theresa
        &mdash; the leading lady, who like, I don&rsquo;t know, had two
        words to say and a lot of dancing and silent acting while Lenny
        sings &mdash; and holy fuck, if you&rsquo;ve seen the video you 
        know already: what a sucktastic rack!&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not a 
        trick effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those tits were <em>not</em>
        added in
        post.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Definitely a gorgeous babe in spite of being a
        nasty bitch, which you&rsquo;ll find out about in a
        minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d say she was late
        twenties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blonde hair and a super-dark complexion so you
        know the hair is dyed but who the fuck cares, am I right?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And the most tremendous cock-gobbler lips in the
        cock-gobbling biz.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I already mentioned that Junior has CG lips, but
        not like these.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like God had a hardon when He
        made her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; A set of warm, wet, suction
        pillows for your dick.&nbsp;&nbsp;You see these lips and
        you&rsquo;re ready to forgive any other imperfection that is not
        morbid obesity.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I walked up to her as she was coming down to the
        stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hadn&rsquo;t met yet so my smile was at its
        shiniest.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I gigcackled,
        &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like to be doing something Frank wanted to
        do?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You know, the ol&rsquo; Chairman of the
        Board wanted to do this song.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;No he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, I have it on pretty good
        authority ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Parp wrote the lyrics and George Vider 
        wrote the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you 
        think <em>you&rsquo;re</em>
        talking about.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I said, like she just pointed
        out that I wasn&rsquo;t good-looking enough to speak to
        her.&nbsp;&nbsp;It stings, but you can&rsquo;t really argue.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        She pushed past me to get to the
        stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was like five steps away from me she
        turned around to give me one last &ldquo;you-are-a-bug&rdquo;
        look.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I resented that.&nbsp;&nbsp;And from that moment
        on I changed her name in my head from Theresa to Main Cunt.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It helped.&nbsp;&nbsp;It still does when I think
        back on it, the cunt.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Now get this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as this stuck-up
        bitch is about to hit the lip of the so-called stage in this
        so-called theatre, in from behind me strides this new chick I
        hadn&rsquo;t seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sneaks up on Main Cunt and
        surprises her with a kiss on the cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Cunt stops,
        smiles, and starts chatting with her pal.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Now, you have to remember that Whispers is
        waiting to talk to Main Cunt. The director is
        waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The husband of Mondi McDade</em>
        is
        waiting. She had her little conversation with me on the fly, while
        she was moving, but her pal shows up and suddenly she forgets where
        she is and starts to chatter.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So Bobby gives her this dull,
        holy-shit-you-can&rsquo;t-be-pulling-this-amateur-crap
        look.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees this look and turns away from her pal who
        gives her kind of a little wave while Main Cunt gets on the stage
        next to Lenny to rehearse the master shot.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The pal has a goofy broad-brimmed hat on, like
        she should be wearing a serape, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, only she 
        isn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s seventy-five in the shade (in 
        March!) and in midtown Manhattan there is <em>no</em>
        shade, only
        hot pavement and guys pushing closets on wheels.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        She looks up at me for a sec &ndash; the pal
        does, I don&rsquo;t know why she looks up at me but there I am and
        we make eye contact and ...
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        She makes a face!&nbsp;&nbsp;And looks
        away!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I&rsquo;m thinking, ya damn cunt!&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
        I need that now!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And then I&rsquo;m thinking: fuck it, Parp is
        right, I gotta get a gym in my house and to fuck with what the wife
        says!&nbsp;&nbsp;And these fucking abs!&nbsp;&nbsp;I gotta do the
        diet and fuck what the wife cooks!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I was frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;My shitty
        body.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicks used to dig me!&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my wife
        is fucking ruining any chance I might have for a fuck on the side
        by making sure I never work out and that I&rsquo;m always pounding
        down steaks and roasts and cakes and beers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Cunt!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Oh, I was so pissed off at the
        world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Tony Parp seemed to be my
        friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp, who knew that wives were the
        enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp, who knew what I had to do to get my cock
        drained, and who told me, and how did I repay him?&nbsp;&nbsp;By
        scoffing ...
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Yeah, right at that second &ndash; before I knew
        he had his eye on my wife&rsquo;s cock-gobbler lips &ndash; I knew
        exactly why I was still hanging around Parp. It was so clear to me,
        right then, that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why I ever had a hard
        time answering Jessica when she asked me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp was the anti-Chuck 
        E. Cheese.&nbsp;&nbsp;It <em>helped</em>
        that he hated
        that shit that everyone else thinks is clean and wholesome and that
        he hates talking about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes him more of a dividing
        line.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around Parp it was like I wasn&rsquo;t too old to
        live my dream without people giggling behind their hands or
        tsk-tsking or rolling their eyes.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It&rsquo;s the way I felt when Depth Charge Rep
        was still going.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the reason guys like me and
        Libby have Parp in our lives, even though we know he&rsquo;s an
        evil fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a wife who decided that letting me
        live my life instead of playing the role of The Man in her domestic
        fantasy was a favor she was doing me, and when she got tired of
        doing me that favor she sat me down and informed me that all I had
        to do to pay her back was give it all up and be a happy,
        pension-earning bartender.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Ask the twat if I could please put a gym in the
        corner of the living room or could we please put the family on a
        low-carb diet so Daddy could lose some fucking
        weight?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d be lucky if she didn&rsquo;t break
        down and cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d get another long-distance call
        from her father telling me how disappointed he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        grew up with dreams and now I have to beg some cunt&rsquo;s
        forgiveness if she overhears me talking about them in my
        sleep.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        If I&rsquo;d listened to Parp a year ago
        I&rsquo;d have pecs and abs right now, I thought, instead of
        looking like such crap that hot chicks cluck their tongues at
        me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I wanted to split right then and run around the
        block.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to get to a clean stretch of floor and
        do push-ups and sit-ups until I puked, and whatever other exercise
        I had to do to look and feel pumped.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I just stood
        there and kind of looked at the space where Main Cunt&rsquo;s pal
        had been standing when she made the face at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still
        had that stupid cup of coffee in my hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;And some
        stupid costume that made me look like some yuppy jerk with crappy
        abs.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey Paulmanheimer.&rdquo; It was Bang
        coming up the aisle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Parp is looking for
        you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So I found Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was off the ladder
        now and standing on the stage, just kind of looking at
        everybody.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I looked crestfallen when he saw me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        know he noticed but he didn&rsquo;t ask why, the callous
        prick.&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted Bobby to know where I was and told
        me not to wander too far away since they might need me in a
        minute.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So Theresa said you wrote the lyrics and
        Vider wrote the music for this,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t know
        that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You said Sinatra wanted to sing
        it!&nbsp;&nbsp;I look like a, well, like a damn idiot.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp laughed and said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
        believe you believed that!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m the only one who thought it
        was a Sinatra tune?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re jerking me around,
        right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, you really thought I was serious about
        Sinatra?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Now, if you&rsquo;ve seen the video, you know 
        they went <em>way</em>
        out of their way to make it seem
        Sinatra-esque.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazzy tune, the finger-snapping, and
        Lenny was pretty much doing a Sinatra
        impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; I&rsquo;m just saying I don&rsquo;t
        think I was the only person who might have been
        fooled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don&rsquo;t.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, now Theresa thinks I&rsquo;m a
        retard,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You told her Sinatra wanted to sing this
        song?&rdquo; He shook his head and laughed and stared at the floor,
        like I was the guy you could always count on to break wacky.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dude.&nbsp;&nbsp;You told
        me Sinatra wanted to sing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believed
        you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not some dumb-but-lovable sitcom
        character.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Just then the assistant-director dyke waved her
        clipboard over her head and screamed &ldquo;Rehearsal!&rdquo; like
        somebody just stabbed her in the ass. People ran around for a few 
        seconds, stopped, then a shaved-headed guy with headphones turned 
        on an audio player and the melody of <em>Little Round Jewish
            Hat</em>
        started playing over the theatre loudspeakers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It was on a piano.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the melody, so
        Lenny&rsquo;s lips could be synched to it later in the
        studio.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then Lenny started to sing.

        Lenny and Main Cunt rehearsed it a couple more
        times.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Smile at each other,&rdquo; Bobby
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Smile?&rdquo; Bang
        laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like breeders or blowers?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Nobody else laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that
        lame.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Whispers gave him a look that said, <em>Dude,
            we&rsquo;re trying to make a film here.</em>
        Bang stopped laughing
        and scratched his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant-director dyke
        looked at him like she just caught him crapping on the
        sidewalk.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Jesus, ya clown,&rdquo; she said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We rehearsed it some more.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of
        us.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Lenny and Main Cunt smiled at each other, right,
        then they&rsquo;re &ldquo;swingin&rsquo; down the Soho
        strip.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        By the way, kids, there <em>is</em>
        no
        &ldquo;Soho Strip.&rdquo; If you think there is because you heard
        about it in the video, consider yourself a victim of one of
        Parp&rsquo;s many lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right, he made it
        up so he&rsquo;d have something to rhyme with &ldquo;clip,&rdquo;
        the lazy shit.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So down on this &ldquo;Soho Strip,&rdquo; Lenny
        and Main Cunt walk past other people like me and, as it turns out,
        Main Cunt&rsquo;s pal with the string-shoulder tank top and gaucho
        hat.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Really, you could look at the
        video.&nbsp;&nbsp;There we are, see us?&nbsp;&nbsp;Only she took
        the gaucho hat off before they started
        shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m the guy next to her doing my famous
        &ldquo;nonplussed&rdquo; look.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s kind of a
        one-take double take. Bobby thought it would be cool if me and the
        pal were pretending to be out on a date, which was okay with
        me.&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave me a chance to act suave.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So there we are in front of the green screen,
        swingin&rsquo; down the Soho &ldquo;strip,&rdquo; when we see this
        zany guy lurch for a small piece of felt pulled off his head by
        some fishing line.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I gigcackled on one take.&nbsp;&nbsp;That could
        have been a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Main Cunt&rsquo;s pal just
        smiled like we were on a date and she loved my strange little
        laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was really starting to admire her
        ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low-rise jeans with the black tank top that
        didn&rsquo;t quite reach all the way she had a bare midriff and I
        could almost &ndash; almost &ndash; see ass-cleavage.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Cut,&rdquo; Bobby said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;CUT!!!!!&rdquo; the assistant-director
        dyke screamed.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; Bobby
        said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be checking Cameron&rsquo;s ass
        when Lenny&rsquo;s hat flies off his head.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ...&nbsp;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a
        character thing,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
