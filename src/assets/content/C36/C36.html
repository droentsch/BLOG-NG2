	<div class="chapterSubhead">Like on a Farm</div>
	<div class='body'>The story about Ramon and the butt-plugs got me
		thinking that yeah, Cynthia could be just what Paulie needs on the
		side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit, I didn&rsquo;t think about Cammy once during
		that whole walk up Ninth Avenue.</div>
	<div class='body'>We walked past a big theatrical hardware store
		and boom &mdash; right next to it is her brick apartment building five
		steps up off the street.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh my God I got to crap,&rdquo; she said
		as she yanked the keys out of that tight little pocket in those tight
		little pants.&nbsp;&nbsp;We went through the first door into a tiny
		vestibule and then through another door on the other side.</div>
	<div class='body'>But as she worked the locks I noticed she
		wasn&rsquo;t urgent.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like somebody who
		was afraid she was about to load into her pants.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact,
		she said &ldquo;I got to crap&rdquo; kind of low and breathy, like it
		was supposed to make my hardon harder.</div>
	<div class='body'>She looked at me and licked her lips and
		started working the lock on the first door on the left.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ground floor front.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She stared in my face until I stared back.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I crap big,&rdquo; she
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like on a farm.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a
		reflex.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a big exclamation point was taking over my
		brain.</div>
	<div class='body'>She grinned at me and opened her
		door.&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed her in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the middle of
		the room was a big black metal dumbell and some sneakers that I
		tripped over.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh those my
		boyfriend&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry.&nbsp;&nbsp;He in
		L.A.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Your boyfriend&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry
		though he gone all week.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She rubbed her ass and winked at me <em>but at no time did she
			move for the bathroom</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know though,&rdquo; I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say you had a
		boyfriend.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well you didn&rsquo;t ask,
		Papicito.&nbsp;&nbsp;And why you care?&nbsp;&nbsp;He don&rsquo;t
		care.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the code.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She broke out laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
		code!&nbsp;&nbsp;You married and you gonna lick my holes for
		me!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Still.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a guy
		thing.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; she
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I almost ran the two blocks to the
		subway.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the train there were seats but I couldn&rsquo;t
		sit. I just leaned against the door and looked at my reflection in the
		glass of the door across from me.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then out of nowhere I shivered like I&rsquo;d
		shaken hands with Dahmer.</div
</div>
