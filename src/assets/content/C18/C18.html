	<div class="chapterSubhead">Hopes and The Getting Up Of Them</div>
	<div class='body'>Note to Jessica: It&rsquo;s not helping to remember how Cammy got my hopes up.</div>
	<div class='body'>Note to students studying this work of vengeance and justice a hundred years from now:
		<em>getting your hopes up</em> is what we call one of the cruelest things a human can do to a fellow human.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
		industrialized world, anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And not counting things humans do to other humans with pliers and piano wire.</div>
	<div class='body'>Maybe they still do it in your century and they call it something more modern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like cyberdream-jacking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
		digital de-hoping.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you&rsquo;ve made it against the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to think that you have.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Getting your hopes up</em> means someone deliberately makes you happy, optimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;It means they make you visualize
		a future in which something wonderful has come true for you. And once you come to believe in the likelihood of that wonderful
		future, the person who got your hopes up tells you it was a big fat lie, so you have to watch that happy future disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;So
		you can feel like you lost something you never really had to begin with.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Getting your hopes up</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s something you can do to yourself: then it&rsquo;s just stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
		when you do it to someone else?&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s evil, man.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I was a teen me and my pals paid a chick fifteen bucks to tell a fat pig named Ricky she had a crush on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
		name was Marcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a slut.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore garters to school with this really wide gap, like a hooker,
		and we kind of made fun of her for being loose but we all wanted to fuck her anyway and she knew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember
		her sitting at the table in the cafeteria looking at me with this big smirk on her face and her elbows on the table while
		she tore a piece of bread apart with her fingers in front of her face.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I know you want to fuck me,&rdquo; she said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Do
		<em>not</em>,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>She laughed and put the bread in her mouth. &ldquo;Okay, well, my pussy&rsquo;s nice and tight ...&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Anyway, we knew that Ricky was beating off to her and didn&rsquo;t even have the smarts to know that he wasn&rsquo;t supposed
		to act like he didn&rsquo;t want to fuck her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, lookit you kids: he was a fatty.&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl with
		a nice ass and a garter gap said she wanted to grab his cock.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was he going to do, get coy?</div>
	<div class='body'>Anyway, Marcy
		<em>got his hopes up.</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Then &ndash; while he was watching &ndash; she came over to our table in the cafeteria to make us pay up.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
		could see the look on Ricky&rsquo;s face when we were all laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that look.&nbsp;&nbsp;That horrible
		look that says you can&rsquo;t even trust your own happiness any more because it might be just a bunch of assholes fucking
		with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the feeling that says you were a chump and the whole world saw it.</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like for me now, remembering that first day Cammy came on to me.</div>
	<div class='body'>Now how is
		<em>that</em> supposed to be therapeutic?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>You think Ricky was a chump for letting a paid-off teen-twat get his hopes up?&nbsp;&nbsp;He was nothing next to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
		Cammy framed her cunt at me?&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved Parp right then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, he delivered, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;If it
		hadn&rsquo;t been for him I&rsquo;d have been at Chuck E. Cheese that day and fingering the barrel of the metaphorical
		revolver.</div>
	<div class='body'>So I was glowing all over with esteem for my old pal the Parpster.&nbsp;&nbsp;How&rsquo;s that for chumpiness?</div>
	<div class='body'>I stood there in front of the green screen at Hannibal&rsquo;s Demise that day last March, doing my patented &ldquo;nonplussed&rdquo;
		look for the camera and thinking about Cammy&rsquo;s cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her just-framed cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her no-doubt-sweet
		cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cunt I&rsquo;d never seen but was pretty sure I&rsquo;d see pretty soon. I thought about what a pronounced,
		meat-friendly mound it must be.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was standing there thinking that as soon as they were done with my close-up I was going to mount the risers to where she
		was sitting and close the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of my dick was moving against my thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the start
		of the days-long serial hardons you get when you first meet a chick and you know you&rsquo;re going to fuck her unless
		one of you gets arrested or disfigured first.</div>
	<div class='body'>And in case you&rsquo;re wondering, no, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid I&rsquo;d have to explain Admiral Ballsy&rsquo;s sudden muscularity
		to the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;See, about a year after Sammy was born I had an online babe I was IM-ing for months before it blew
		over.&nbsp;&nbsp;She lived in Kansas City and she could really talk some filth.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sent me a pic that showed
		her having this uber-thin waist but with a really huge ass with a thong on it that had no chance for survival; a thong
		that disappeared into her butt-crack like it was lint between sofa cushions. And she stuck that ass
		<em>out</em> at the camera, like she was saying,
		<em>Yeah, my ass is huge, now shut up and put your cock in it.</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Hey, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s a mainstream fantasy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it isn&rsquo;t, just remember: I&rsquo;m an
		artist.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>She sent me a sound file of her voice saying, &ldquo;I wanna lick yer balls, Paulie,&rdquo; over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;At
		least, I played it over and over so I could get her voice down &mdash; the lowness, the breathiness, the Midwestern accent
		&mdash; before I deleted it forever.</div>
	<div class='body'>I mean, the hard drive is in my living room!</div>
	<div class='body'>We kept chatting about meeting up and for about two weeks I had a cock I could have pushed open French doors with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		was pounding Junior&rsquo;s cunt every day while that was going on, until finally she figured I was so into fucking her
		that it might be worth it to try withholding sex again to see if she could make me do stuff.</div>
	<div class='body'>And it might have worked, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;No kidding.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Junior had asked for a clean exchange of services then
		fuck it, she&rsquo;d have been the boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Spend Christmas
		<em>and</em> New Year&rsquo;s at your mother&rsquo;s in exchange for a month of anal? Sign me up, babe!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>But Junior could never come right out and tell me what it was she wanted me to do in exchange for the sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
		needed me to guess, and I suck at guessing, so all she ended up doing was driving me into the shower for half an hour twice
		a day.</div>
	<div class='body'>And through all of that she never had the slightest clue that the hardons were for the ass crack of some babe who tortured
		me through my computer.</div>
	<div class='body'>I guess if that happened now I could IM my Kansas City babe all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could leave anything I wanted on the hard
		drive forever, like I was Parp, who has a screensaver of SuicideGirls all bent over with their cunt lips hanging.</div>
	<div class='body'>Nah, I couldn&rsquo;t even do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unless I wanted to to explain cunt lips to the boys and I&rsquo;m really
		not up for that.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking care of the kids in the Summer heat, pounding cock to Internet porn
		while the wife bites dick in California.</div>
	<div class='body'>But back on day one of
		<em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em> it was all about Admiral Ballsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wife was just a, well, she was just a
		good team player when it came to raising up the kids.
