	<div class='body'>The next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess overall it was
		great, but it started out on an ominous note that I didn&#8217;t know
		was ominous at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came out of the bedroom to grab
		a muffin or something for breakfast I caught the wife sitting at the
		table in the kitchen area all quiet and sipping some coffee with her
		tits hidden in the folds of a big gray sweatshirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking
		for my favorite cup &#8212; the one with the extra-wide bottom &#8212;
		when out of the blue Junior asks me if Jessica can recommend a
		therapist for her because she can&#8217;t stand life any more and
		needs help coping.</div>
	<div class='body'>She said it just like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I
		can&#8217;t stand life any more and I need help coping.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>In hindsight I know I should have paid a little
		more attention to that statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess you could say it was a
		warning sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m pretty sure that this juncture or
		crossroads or whatever in Junior&#8217;s life is what set her
		spiralling into the abyss of life as Parp&#8217;s fuck toy.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&#8220;Well bay-yabe,&#8221; I said in a sing-songy way that was me
		trying to sound really understanding of her feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
		Cammy&#8217;s ass on the brain like Newton had calculus and there
		wasn&#8217;t much space for any other input.&nbsp;&nbsp; But hey:&nbsp;&nbsp; at
		least I was <em>trying</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Can I
		do anything to help?&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Can you recommend...can Jessica
		recommend somebody?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>When she asked that the second time my brain
		kicked in and suddenly I was able to put Cammy&#8217;s ass on hold
		with no problem, like pressing pause on a video player.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		See, I&#8217;d always thought it would be great to have Junior in
		therapy with Jessica because even though Jessica is a therapist and
		ethically couldn&#8217;t tell me anything Junior said, I also knew she
		was my friend and that <em>as</em> my friend I
		could probably get her to tell me <em>everything
			</em>Junior said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I could even get her to give me a
		transcript.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be the next best thing to reading the
		wife&#8217;s mind.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you just see
		Jessica?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Is that allowed?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;You mean because she&#8217;s already
		seeing me?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wife had recently taken to
		rubbing her temples when she thought a question was too stupid to
		answer and she was rubbing them now.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure it happens all the
		time,&#8221; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;In fact, it may help her analysis to
		be treating us both.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Oh Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really didn&#8217;t
		need to hear you say &#8216;treating us both.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like
		we&#8217;re both going to be in the same room getting the same
		medicine.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp; So...do you wanna do it or
		what?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Babe?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Yes, yes I want to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
		just...I&#8217;m sure whatever treatment I need it can&#8217;t be the
		same as yours, please God.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I knew she was trying to needle me into
		starting the argument she was dying to have so I played the mature
		card instead.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Well dear, have you thought about how
		we&#8217;re going to pay for your therapy?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I can afford
		mine only because it&#8217;s in the union health plan.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;That plan covers wives, doesn&#8217;t
		it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is that just something else you forgot about along with
		the rest of your obligations to this family?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Yeah, she really wanted to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
		that last line was delivered a little too un-bumpily, like she&#8217;d
		been rehearsing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was right about the wives-too part
		of the insurance plan so it looked like the stars had aligned for the
		wife&#8217;s Jessica therapy.</div>
	<div class='body'>Right then was when the boys woke up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		They got out the plastic light sabers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wife started to
		cry.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to hug her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She pushed me away like my skin
		was made of turd but by then I was back to banging Cammy&#8217;s ass
		in my brain and didn&#8217;t care.</div>
	<div class='body'>So Mommy changed her clothes and went to work
		and Daddy made breakfast and escorted the boys to school and showed up
		at Vider&#8217;s at about ten to put in some producer time in front of
		Cammy.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		While I was on the subway down to the club I began to question how
		much I could actually trust Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, what if Cynthia was
		there even after he promised me she wouldn&#8217;t be?&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; What if she was telling people I ran like a weasel from the
		prospect of tasting her clit?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uberbad.&nbsp;&nbsp; What if Cammy heard
		about it and wrote me off?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if she got interested in
		somebody else on the set and I had to watch today while she framed her
		cunt at <em>him</em>?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Then I thought: what if <em>everyone</em> hates
		me?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if...what if everyone else on the shoot hates me for
		not getting in until ten while they&#8217;ve been there since six?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		That last part?&nbsp;&nbsp; The part about them maybe hating me because I
		wasn&#8217;t there since the crack of dawn?&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I thought
		it I thought: Fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Them</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ya
		know?&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got kids and a wife who works.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I
		closed my eyes for a second and imagined myself giving them the
		finger.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You</em>,&#8221;
		I told them in my brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m a producer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m
		kicking in the bucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Ten is early
			enough</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>When I got into Vider&#8217;s they were in the
		middle of some setup that never made it into the final cut.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
		bit where the guy who lost his yarmulke and the girl who found it are
		dancing on a nightclub table.</div>
	<div class='body'>Anyway, the whole crew was in a circle around
		this table that Lenny Paine and what&#8217;s-her-name the actress were
		standing on top of.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I came in someone saw me and signalled
		someone else and then it was like a siren went off on my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Everyone just dropped what they had in their hands and turned around
		and looked at me and applauded.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, not one of them
		hesitated.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all in on the gag.</div>
	<div class='body'>Including Cammy.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;What?!&#8221; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
		getting steamed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;So this is all because I&#8217;m
		late?!&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, I would have loved to have given them the
		finger like I imagined but Cammy was there and she was laughing at me
		with them.</div>
	<div class='body'>Cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t ready for that.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Forget something this morning,
		Paul?&#8221; Vider asked when the hoots died down.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Fuck no,&#8221; I said,
		&#8220;I&#8212;&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Then it hit me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was supposed to pick up
		Parp with the prop van at like six or something.</div>
	<div class='body'>Now, you don&#8217;t know me but swear to any
		god you want if I&#8217;d remembered Parp in the parking lot on
		Eighty-Third I would have definitely been there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I would
		have broken my ass to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that I
		didn&#8217;t think of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just never went across my brain.</div>
</div>
