	<div class="chapterSubhead">The Neighborhood Carnality</div>
	<div class='body'>It was late last night when I finished that
		last chapter. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now listen: I still have a lot to tell about that ride
		with big-butt Belinda but I had to get some sleep because I still get
		some pretty busy days even though I&rsquo;m laid off and the wife is
		out of town on a cock-sucking gig.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh. &nbsp;&nbsp;Did I mention I got laid off? &nbsp;&nbsp;I guess maybe
		not. &nbsp;&nbsp;So I&rsquo;m kind of stuck with no money coming in right now
		except unemployment.</div>
	<div class='body'>Shit. &nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be bartending was what you did
		when you lost your regular job. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now it&rsquo;s the regular job you
		lose. &nbsp;&nbsp;Is that insane or what?</div>
	<div class='body'>Some people blame the union. &nbsp;&nbsp;Not me. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to
		the union I&rsquo;ve got some great benefits. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the bennies that
		pay for Dr. &nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica. &nbsp;&nbsp;So every couple years or so the bosses push back
		with a raft of lay-offs. &nbsp;&nbsp;Big deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just a matter of time
		before the union gets us reinstated.</div>
	<div class='body'>Just. &nbsp;&nbsp;A matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;Of time.</div>
	<div class='body'>In the meantime I&rsquo;m sweating my ass off
		in the summer humidity and taking the kids to morning Bible Camp.</div>
	<div class='body'>I know. &nbsp;&nbsp;Bible Camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;Seems unlikely a
		full-blooded blue-stater like me would take his kids to a summer
		church thing, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;It was Junior&rsquo;s idea but I have to say I
		pretty much went right along with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;First off, it keeps the kids out
		of trouble in the non-school months. &nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it gives me a few hours
		off to be a grown-up on my own among my fellow grown-ups. &nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it
		teaches the boys some of those basic morals and things about
		compassion that they probably don&rsquo;t get enough of from anyplace
		else.</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s three good reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;So fuck off.</div>
	<div class='body'>Bible Camp in the city is a couple of rooms in
		a church basement. &nbsp;&nbsp;So the &ldquo;camp&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;part is more of a prayer
		than a real place where you can go and cook meat over a fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;
		It&rsquo;s pretty pathetic, too, when you see how they take these
		little sunless cement rooms and decorate them with cardboard cut-outs
		of trees and one or two teepees made of blankets with the profiles of
		animals etched into them.</div>
	<div class='body'>This morning&rsquo;s walk to Bible Camp
		featured a brush with the neighborhood carnality. &nbsp;&nbsp;Me and the boys were
		walking down the sidewalk in a steamy morning torpor when we made a
		stop to pick up Carol Anne Hurdy &mdash; Harry&rsquo;s seven year-old
		&ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; out in front of her mom&rsquo;s
		apartment building.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Your mom lets you stand out here all by
		yourself?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked her.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah! &nbsp;&nbsp;So?!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Just askin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And the three of us commenced our drowse down
		the hill between Amsterdam and Broadway toward the church that has the
		cellar that is Bible Camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;We were the Man Squad Plus One.</div>
	<div class='body'>Jackhammers were jacking.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I smell boogers!&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sammy said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Carol Anne shouted at
		Harry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have a McBoner!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And she stopped and pointed at that part of his
		anatomy where a little boy is wont to get a McBoner.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I do <em>not!</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;he shouted back.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a McBoner?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sammy
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &mdash; uh &mdash; &rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I
		was struggling here. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was tempted to say it was what McDonald&rsquo;s
		made out of the bones that didn&rsquo;t make it into Chicken
		McNuggets. &nbsp;&nbsp;I might even have been stupid enough to say that, too, but
		Carol Anne jumped in first.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his <em>fuck stick!</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;she screamed.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I expected Sammy to ask me what a fuck stick
		was, but he didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he and Harry marched on in silence,
		their jaws stern and their brows furrowed, as if they were little
		justices deliberating on new evidence.</div>
	<div class='body'>Carol Anne was only seven like I said but the
		little bitch was miffing me. &nbsp;&nbsp;You parents know what I mean. &nbsp;&nbsp;Harry has
		only a few years before his own balls sell him out to the nearest
		tramp a shiny skirt. &nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few years before he wakes up to a brain
		full of ass.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Just a few years. &nbsp;&nbsp;Less than a decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to go to Carol
		Anne&rsquo;s house and grab her stupid mom by her camouflage print
		blouse and say, &ldquo;Just what do you think you&rsquo;re doing,
		talking about boners and fuck sticks in front of your daughter like
		it&rsquo;s normal banter so she can come over and laugh at my
		kid&rsquo;s dick?! &nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t little boys deserve a chance to rest up
		before the slam-dance? &nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t they get a few years to read comic
		books? &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t my boys get a childhood?!</em>&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I ranted thus mentally on the way to morning
		Bible Camp while Carol Anne Hurdy looked at my face and giggled.</div>
