        SpongeBob Interlude
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Just so you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Life didn&rsquo;t stop for me so I could write up this book this Summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I typed out that last chapter about a day ago during a SpongeBob marathon with the kids. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And SpongeBob takes his toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I lived in Brooklyn back when Williamsburg was a slum there was this alley the building superintendent used to call Cat Scrootch Alley, because every Summer night you could hear some cats in heat screaming to get porked and then screaming even louder during the pork proper. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was easier concentrating in an apartment over Cat Scrootch Alley than it is in an apartment with that asshole SpongeBob. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I know what you single kids are thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re thinking, <em>SpongeBob sounds good to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant babysitter. </em>
        &mdash; Sure, as long as you can tell yourself that SpongeBob isn&rsquo;t really melting the kids&rsquo; brains which, let&rsquo;s face it, he probably is. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But forget what SpongeBob might be doing to the boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is I get to overhear the whole marathon and it&rsquo;s <em>definitely</em>
        melting <em>my</em>
        brains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready!&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m ready!&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; is what I hear bouncing around inside my skull.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when I&rsquo;m out trying to get some cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when I&rsquo;m listening to my Ramones. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I&rsquo;m in New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be in a nightclub downtown with a drunk-but-hot chick, somebody wised-up with realistic expectations, hearing a saxophone moan like a woman about to pop. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It&rsquo;s not like the wife is here to watch the boys this Summer, which I think I might have mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m kinda laid off and trying to write this tome out with barely more than two fingers pecking away. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So get off my back. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And it&rsquo;s hot here, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;The air conditioning is just for shit when you have virtually no wall-padding, you know, insulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I love New York. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Here&rsquo;s how desperate I got last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;My boys are seven years old (Harry) and five years old (Sam), and I tried to get them interested in watching the movie <em>All About Eve</em>. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Don&rsquo;t laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not admit it, but if you&rsquo;re a grownup who lives with small kids I know you&rsquo;ve tried something like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t break out of the playpen they&rsquo;ve turned your home into, so one day you get this brilliant idea to bring the outside inside. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It&rsquo;s a sanity move.&nbsp;&nbsp;It never works.&nbsp;&nbsp;But you keep getting the same flash of inspiration, year in and year out, never remembering until you fail that you&rsquo;ve had the same idea a dozen times before. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So. <em>All About Eve</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we didn&rsquo;t even get through the stage door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve didn&rsquo;t even get her raincoat and hat off before the carping began. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Harry: &ldquo;Do we <em>have</em>
        to watch this?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was really quite a plaint. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sam:  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too <em>talky</em>
        for a movie.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The Bruckheimer Fallacy. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Me:  &ldquo;You kids are lucky Daddy doesn&rsquo;t make you watch <em>Kind Hearts and Coronets. </em>&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I was putting gravified utensils in the dishwasher. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;<em>Ewwww. </em>&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute Harry, you know that movie?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Then why did you say, &lsquo;ewww&rsquo;?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it talky?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;<em>Yuck, </em>&rdquo; said Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s all gray.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Is it all <em>gray</em>, Daddy?&rdquo; asked Harry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like he just heard a rumor he was going to have to work his way through community college because his daddy is a deadbeat. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sam:  &ldquo;<em>Yuck. </em>&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Harry:  &ldquo;I like <em>color</em>.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sam:  &ldquo;When is Mommy coming back?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Time for bed, kids.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That was what did I say?&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, last night they got brain-melting SpongeBob because they remembered not to ask Daddy when Mommy was coming home. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Okay, so I left off with me and my therapy and Dr. Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasten your seatbelts ...
