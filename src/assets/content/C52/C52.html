        The Alibi
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The next morning I was consumed with the post-mortem.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I didn&rsquo;t set the alarm the night before so at about quarter to ten I heard my phone give me one of those notification beeps and it roused me out of my stupor.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I found the phone and swiped the screen. &nbsp;The beep was from my calendar. &nbsp;&ldquo;REMINDER: Go to Parp&rsquo;s house and take the bus home from there. &nbsp;THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT! &nbsp;DO NOT IGNORE!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body"><em>Oh right</em>, I thought. &nbsp;<em>The alibi</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I really wanted to go straight home. &nbsp;I mean, what were the odds Junior or one of her neighborhood chums would see me getting off the bus and notice it was the <em>wrong</em>&nbsp;bus?
    </div>
    <div class="body">But I knew beforehand I would be tempted to play it sloppy with the alibi. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I put the reminder on my calendar with all the capital letters and exclamation points. &nbsp;So I made up my mind to do the right thing and work the helping-Parp-with-post story as planned and not think about the inconvenience of taking the bus to Parp&rsquo;s neighborhood so I could get off and wait for another bus and take that bus to <em>my</em>&nbsp;neighborhood.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I looked around me on the bed. &nbsp;About a half dozen empty bottles of various kinds of liquor were scattered around me on the sheets.
    </div>
    <div class="body">The TV remote was on the nightstand so I grabbed it and flicked on the TV and out popped people talking to the grown-up actor who used to be the kid who played Harry Potter.
    </div>
    <div class="body">That&rsquo;s when I noticed I was pretty sick to my stomach and ran off to the bathroom and heaved like I was rushing a frat. &nbsp;When I got back to the bedroom I flipped around the TV channels but all I could find were political talkshows. &nbsp;Older women wearing suits that hid their cleavage away like it was a disgusting secret. &nbsp;Like they didn&rsquo;t want you to know Satan had given them hooves where their tits should be. &nbsp;And old men drooling and stuttering and a couple young chuckletards and all of them saying the same shit they said last week and the week before that.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I snapped it off before I could picture them cashing their paychecks.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Then I just let the room be silent for awhile. &nbsp;A little fem-laughter and footsteps leaked in from the hallway. &nbsp;I thought I could feel the nausea again so I laid back on the bed and closed my eyes.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I dozed off for a few minutes and when I woke up I decided it was time to get the adventure over with and no more excuses.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I went back into the bathroom and saw Parp&rsquo;s Roundabout Inn Gold Card tilted against the tiles behind the sink where Cammy left it. &nbsp;I washed the smell of Cammy completely off my face and hands but I didn&rsquo;t shower because the alibi demanded I look disheveled since I&rsquo;d allegedly spent the night at Parp&rsquo;s helping him out of all the jams he&rsquo;d gotten himself into with the post-production of <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">A half hour later I was checked out and on my way to Parp&rsquo;s.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I had it on my mind as I wandered out into the soon-to-be Spring, New-York air and got on the bus that I didn&rsquo;t know whether to feel good about the night&rsquo;s events or bad about them. &nbsp;I guess I just felt a little guilty and miffed at myself.
    </div>
    <div class="body">See: I knew it was good to get a blowjob. &nbsp;Put a check in that box. &nbsp;But then there was the grown woman pretending to be a ten year-old boy and then pretending to be his bitch of a mother who called my dick &ldquo;lo mein&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Limpet&rdquo; before and after strapping my face into her ass.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And I didn&rsquo;t fuck her! &nbsp;Not technically. &nbsp;Did my cock ensconce in the juice mound? &nbsp;It did not!
    </div>
    <div class="body">When the bus pulled up to the stop closest to Parp&rsquo;s apartment in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen I got off and walked over to the Starbucks at World Wide Plaza.
    </div>
    <div class="body">It was jammed with tourists from a big red bus parked right outside. &nbsp;I stood on the sidewalk and looked in the window and thought it over. &nbsp;I really didn&rsquo;t want to surf that tsunami. &nbsp;But I needed the caffeine so I had a smoke on the sidewalk while repeating my keep-calm mantra. &nbsp;Then I strolled in and tried to stay cool.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Any New Yorker will tell you that the worst thing about the tourist is his ability to find exactly the right spot between you and the place you&rsquo;re trying to get to and then stand stock still in that place like an Ohio-size bag of crap.
    </div>
    <div class="body">It&rsquo;s uncanny. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like their super-power. &nbsp;Need to get into a restaurant? &nbsp;There will be tourists having a conversation <em>in the doorway</em>. &nbsp;Need to get off an escalator? &nbsp;There will be tourists standing like Stonehenge right at the top, scanning the horizon for Jesus and the angels. &nbsp;Need to get out of a subway? &nbsp;There will be tourists walking slowly up the center of the narrow stairs. &nbsp;Need to get a quick coffee while you&rsquo;re rushing to work? &nbsp;There will be tourists at the front of the line, negotiating a specialty item with the barista like it&rsquo;s a thirty-year mortgage.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And when the inevitable happens? &nbsp;When the native New Yorkers push their way into the restaurant and off the escalator and up the stairs and to the front of the line? &nbsp;The tourists snap their heads around in semi-panic. &nbsp;You can almost hear their neurons scratching down the mental notes to tell their pals back in Bulldump, Wisconsin.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Well, that&rsquo;s who stood between me and the coffee in the Starbuck&rsquo;s at Worldwide Plaza. &nbsp;Not one tourist. &nbsp;Not five. &nbsp;At least a dozen.
    </div>
    <div class="body">But I didn&rsquo;t care. &nbsp;By the time I got to the back of the line I was pretty focused on making sure my alibi was Junior-proof.
    </div>
    <div class="body">While I was standing in line it occurred to me that I could really sell the alibi if I called Junior up and told her I was on my way home. &nbsp;And while I&rsquo;m telling her this? &nbsp;In the background Parp could be making some identifiably Parpesque noises. &nbsp;Like: &ldquo;Hey Paul. &nbsp;Come here. &nbsp;I really need your help with this,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Hey Paul. &nbsp;Can you make it quick? &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do this without you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">And if I was lucky? &nbsp;Junior would be sitting in a pew at church and wouldn&rsquo;t pick up. &nbsp;Then me and Parp could do an uninterrupted performance for her voicemail.
    </div>
    <div class="body">It was a stroke of genius. &nbsp;You know what it&rsquo;s like to feel your cerebrum catch fire when you get a great idea? &nbsp;Well my whole brain just exploded into flames right there on line at Starbucks.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I called up Parp and&hellip; no joy. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;Just the brainless echoing abyss of his outgoing message. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s Tony! &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t come to the phone right now &mdash; &rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">I hung up as hard as I possibly could on a touchscreen. &nbsp;Man, that was annoying.
    </div>
    <div class="body">The more I thought about it? &nbsp;The angrier I got. &nbsp;<em>Today is alibi day, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!</em>&nbsp; The guy sees my name on his caller id and he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s important enough to pick up? &nbsp;And what if he was asleep and Junior called? &nbsp;The whole alibi would be out the window!
    </div>
    <div class="body">&ldquo;Next on line,&rdquo; the barista said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Nobody moved.
    </div>
    <div class="body">&ldquo;Next on <em>line!</em>&rdquo; she insisted.
    </div>
    <div class="body">The morbidly obese guy in front of me shambled out of his daydream and sort of fell forward in the direction of the barista. &nbsp;He was wearing a tan suit and amber-framed eyeglasses covered with dandruff. &nbsp;He was grotesque. &nbsp;Blonde. &nbsp;Balding.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And depressed. &nbsp;You could tell from the way he ordered his tall latte. &nbsp;Like a little mouse. &nbsp;And he teetered on his feet while reaching for his wallet. &nbsp;And he never made eye contact with the barista, just stared over her shoulder, like he could see through the wall behind her for a thousand yards.
    </div>
    <div class="body">My Uncle Carl used to stare straight ahead like that. &nbsp;At dinner and at the beach and at the market&hellip; &nbsp;Like he was staring down a dark tunnel only he could see. &nbsp;Once I asked him why he did that and he said, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m wondering if tonight&rsquo;s the night I&rsquo;ll have the stones to blow out my brains.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">He just kept eating his dinner after saying that and we talked about the Red Sox and I never brought it up again.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Then one winter morning my Aunt Kim got up and she was alone and figured Carl had split early for work. &nbsp;So she made some coffee and took it down to the pier they had in front of their little lake house. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s just standing there sipping coffee and shivering because it&rsquo;s freezing outside and she looks down at the iced-over lake and underneath the ice is this naked guy staring up at her and a second later she figures out it&rsquo;s Carl.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s when she screamed.
    </div>
    <div class="body">For the record? &nbsp;Carl&rsquo;s brains were still in his skull but the verdict was that he definitely offed himself. &nbsp;Weighed himself down with dumbbells tied with ropes around his ankles and shoved off the end of the pier. &nbsp;Then the surface froze and a few hours later out walks Aunt Kim.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I&rsquo;m guessing his last second-to-last thoughts were: <em>This&rsquo;ll teach her</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">His <em>last</em>&nbsp;thoughts? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m assuming they were more along the lines of: <em>Holy shit! &nbsp;Somebody untie my fucking legs!</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">But back to the tale at hand. &nbsp;I finally got my caffeine and swilled it down and jumped on the uptown bus for my place.
    </div>
    <div class="body">When I got upstairs to the Fam Castle it was deserted. &nbsp;At the door I shouted, &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s home!&rdquo; and heard an echo bounce back like the Ghost of Divorce Future. &nbsp;<em>Still at church</em>, I thought. &nbsp;So I stumbled down to the bathroom and showered off the rest of my grunge. &nbsp;Then I stretched out on the sofa in the living room for a nap.
    </div>
    <div class="body">It took me awhile to nod off because of the coffee, and while I was lying there I got all stern with myself about the future and made some resolutions. &nbsp;I promised myself I would workout like Parp, eat like Parp, and ask Parp about the dick exercises. &nbsp;<em>In fact</em>, I thought, <em>I should become a version of Parp</em>. &nbsp;You know, a socially-acceptable version with a human soul.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Then I finally fell asleep and didn&rsquo;t wake up till Sammy hit me on the head with an action figure.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Captain America or somebody.
    </div>
