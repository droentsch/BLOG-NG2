        Junior's Gothic Chasm
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This is Junior:  dark brown skin, almost mulatto, creamy, like a dark peanut butter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great rack.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tits out to here with massive brown nipples like big chocolate cookies that turn into hard little rocks when she wants to get plowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin waist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lollipop ass that&rsquo;s started to spread just a little.&nbsp;&nbsp; Short, so not much in the legs department, which is kind of unfortunate because long slender legs are great cunt stems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark hair, no curls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cock-gobbler lips, like the ones you see on some Spanish and Portuguese chicks.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The whoring twat.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The dark skin was the source of a lot of jokes when I first found out how black Corrinne Senior literally sucked Junior&rsquo;s white father out of his marriage.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Are you <em>sure</em>
        you&rsquo;re not the black chick&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I said that at least once every two days for a month.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And then when I got it that she had a sense of humor about the irony of her dark skin and Corrinne Senior I started saying, &ldquo;Mighty white of me&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the time.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The first time I said it was right after balling her doggy-style.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Her:  &ldquo;I love it that you thought to pull my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; It made my cunt want to explode.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Me:  &ldquo;Mighty white of me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She laughed her ass off.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She even joined in a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I told her I&rsquo;d let her have the seat in the sun on a cold day at an amusement park and she said, &ldquo;Mighty white of you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I loved that back-and-forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have done it for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could have been our signature banter as a couple.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Junior got tired of it pretty quick and right after the wedding she told me to shut the fuck up about it.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        In spite of the fact that this book is about getting revenge on Junior for being a sadistic slut, I have to admit she&rsquo;s a pretty wild fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has a <em>great</em>
        mouth when she&rsquo;s motivated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouth and I used to get along <em>real</em>
        well.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior&rsquo;s cunt though ...&nbsp;&nbsp;different story.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cunt and I have one of those polite, awkward relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to make the cunt available, but I haven&rsquo;t been on good terms with it since I made the mistake of seeing Sam get born.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Boys.&nbsp;&nbsp; You boys out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Never do that</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some things you can&rsquo;t unsee, <em>and you will want to unsee childbirth</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I mean, after the kid got out of her Junior worked her cunt back into great shape by flexing her snatch muscles on that little metal egg, but still I&rsquo;m at odds with her cunt.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Way at odds.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This gives Jessica and me one more thing to talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the union health plan covers it, so everyone is happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except, you know, I have a social conscience too, so, America&rsquo;s skyrocketing health care costs, blah, blah, blah.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You really want to unsee your son&rsquo;s birth?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;she asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make me ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s important?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;There is nothing  beautiful ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really want therapists and chicks to understand this, &ldquo;there is <em>no way I am going to find that beautiful</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not saying you should do that,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;she said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yuh-huh.&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not saying I should do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; But if I don&rsquo;t do that she&rsquo;s going to stare at me all misty and pouty like I&rsquo;m some sort of sad throwback who wants his wenches to pipe down and poach him up some eggs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I guess it&rsquo;s highly evolved to take some grotesque biological event, call it a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &ldquo;mysterious,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;and expect me to find something beautiful about seeing my wife&rsquo;s guts dragged out through the gothic chasm that used to be a sweet place to put my dick.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica tried to help cancel out that image by giving me a book filled with nothing but pictures of beautiful cunts to look at.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s therapy so what the heck, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem is none of the cunts in that book are Junior&rsquo;s cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the gorgeous, round-mounded, usually-shaved, sometimes embushed,  no-doubt-snug,  no-doubt-sweet places to put one&rsquo;s dick of women who have not had their insides dragged out of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And see, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with any cunt I suspect may not have been stretched into a hangar door by some red slimy brat who has to get out now or else.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I <em>loved</em>
        that book of unchasmed cunts.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Ladies, I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t give birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m saying think twice before you insist on the man witnessing the miracle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you&rsquo;re trying to punish him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>For life</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I&rsquo;m saying nature is not always beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it almost never is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever seen a preying mantis bite the head off a grasshopper?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I grew up in rural Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp; You get a grasshopper, toss it in a jar with a preying mantis, and wait ...&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for it ...&nbsp;&nbsp;chomp!&nbsp;&nbsp; Headless grasshopper.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;The head must be the tastiest part,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;a kid said once.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The whole preying mantis-grasshopper thing?&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies, it&rsquo;s a beautiful miracle.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think so?&nbsp;&nbsp; What ...&nbsp;&nbsp;what&rsquo;s <em>wrong</em>
        with you?
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="body">
        But I rant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah, your wife&rsquo;s gothic chasm of a cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever happened to that video from Chapter Two?&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        story?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, I would have gotten around to that story sooner, but in order for it to make any sense you had to know some things, like my issues with Parp, my need to be lord of all tail, and the fact that Junior&rsquo;s cunt and me are on the outs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And now you know.
    </div>
