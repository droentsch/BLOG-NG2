        Feel the Hate
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When I told Parp about the lady who chased me and said she wanted to fucken fuck me and how she got annoyed when I said, &ldquo;Beg your pardon, what?&rdquo; a couple times, he said, &ldquo;Ya know Paul I've never known why any woman would want to fuck you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, look at you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your abs suck, you have toothpick arms, you&rsquo;re pale, you have a stupid laugh and a square haircut.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an offense against reason that you should arouse desire in a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; That somebody thinks she has to get drunk to tell you she wants you to fuck her ...&nbsp;&nbsp;well, it shakes the foundations of reality as I know it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I&rsquo;m pretty sure Parp saying things like that is one of the reasons why I'm in therapy still.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And that tells you what?&rdquo; Jessica asked not long ago.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It tells me I'm not sure what I'm doing hanging around Parp?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounded better than &ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Not exactly what you would call witty ripostes, but I like to call it therapy.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This is Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica: tall and a little androgynous.&nbsp;&nbsp; Long brown hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like she should be hiking someplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks that sneak up on you, like no makeup and plain clothes that make her body look like a flat plank.&nbsp;&nbsp; But after awhile of watching her move and smile and you&rsquo;re noticing stuff, like her great legs.&nbsp;&nbsp; And rack.&nbsp;&nbsp; And pretty soon you&rsquo;re thinking about how her ass is the perfect pear shape for a tall, thin tomboy and how if you bent her over her desk that pear-shaped ass would make such a plateau that just the sight of it would pull the cock out of your pants.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sometimes I like to imagine her blowing me on top of a bedroll during a hike through a national park.&nbsp;&nbsp; She takes my dick out of her mouth just long enough to say, &ldquo;You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She always says those exact words.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So you've known Tony Parp for how long?&rdquo; she asked in the real world.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It's something like twenty-five years, right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She inherited me from the therapist who inherited me from the therapist who inherited me from my college therapist, so she had a butt-load of notes on Parp.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I guess I keep thinking he'll change,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        (I really wanted to smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; That isn't legal indoors in New York.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked it when it was legal because I didn't get as nervous.)
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When she heard me say I thought Parp would change she hung her head like her neck had been broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hair fell across the desk the way it falls across my chest when she's sucking me off in the bedroll fantasy.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica&rsquo;s been my therapist for a few years.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re friends, which adds a nice dimension to the bedroll fantasy, because in that fantasy we're both cackling about how stupid my wife and her husband are.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She calls her husband &ldquo;the hubster&rdquo; in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bedroll fantasy she calls him &ldquo;no-cock Bob.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I'd like to know how you expect Tony to ever get any better,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don't answer that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ...&nbsp;&nbsp;just let me remind you that you can't get a smoothie from Starbucks.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I thought she could do better than that, metaphor-wise.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Starbucks starts selling smoothies.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Am I right?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Parp is Starbucks ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And the smoothie is something besides what he always says, which depresses you,&rdquo; she said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But it isn&rsquo;t just what Parp says that depresses me.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the noise that inevitably and invariably comes out of his mouth contributes only a small fraction to the shit-swamp that is the experience of knowing Parp.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The rest is the simple fact of his existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason, through no effort of his own, just through numb, blind, retarded luck, none of the karmic rules apply to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t play by the rules you&rsquo;re supposed to end up sucking metaphoric balls.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re supposed to pay a price.&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jail time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Social ostracism.&nbsp;&nbsp; No sex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nervous breakdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Something</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Except if you&rsquo;re Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you can burn down churches and children will hand you flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to that the fact that he&rsquo;s convinced his dumb luck is something the universe owes him and I think you can start to feel the hate.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know why I hang around Parp still?&rdquo; I asked Jessica when I had time to think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to be there to see the look on his face when his luck runs out.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the meantime the rest of us have to watch while some quantum mechanical glitch lets him live like something between a sloth and a shark without ever paying a price.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        For example, jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re constantly blowing off jobs you&rsquo;re supposed to end up in the poorhouse, or in a little room over a grocery store in Brooklyn, or in a residence hotel in Harlem collecting welfare checks.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But Parp blows off his day jobs &mdash; his income jobs &mdash; right and left and what he gets in return are offers for higher-paying day jobs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        No shit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp and I had this friend, Teddy Peltham, who decided to help out his old pal Parpy by giving him a job.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sitting with  the two of them outside on a Summer day two years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the sidewalk in front of some restaurant in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen that sets tables out whenever the temperature gets above sixty.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It turns out Teddy&rsquo;s pretty  ...&nbsp;&nbsp;mmm ...&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>annoyed</em>
        with Parp, so the conversation for about five minutes after we sit down is pretty terse.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; One-word shit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Teddy tells Parp to do something the next day at the job and Parp refuses because it&rsquo;s beneath his dignity or something.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So Teddy really bears down on him and says:  &ldquo;Dude, it&rsquo;s your job on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp; You understand?&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your <em>job</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And Parp says:  &ldquo;Then I guess I can either find a new job or bend over and take it in my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now which one would you choose if you were me?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I thought Teddy was going to burst into tears.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he got really mad and said:  &ldquo;You fucking loose cannon!&nbsp;&nbsp; You are fucking dead meat now!&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you understand!?&nbsp;&nbsp; You have no job!&nbsp;&nbsp; You are fired!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah, Teddy&rsquo;s not what you would call the strong, silent type.&nbsp;&nbsp; Picture a short, flabby guy with glasses and a haircut like the one you see on the Universal Mexican Immigrant in the movies.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But it gave me hope for mankind, seeing Parp get reamed like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sort of expecting the ground to open beneath his feet and swallow him up.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp looked pretty sober for a sec, like somebody&rsquo;d slapped his face.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hey Teddy ...&rdquo; he said, kind of quiet.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Anybody ever tell you you scream like a bitch?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Teddy shook his head and pushed his glasses up on his nose.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are such a fucking asshole, Parp,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Teddy laughed.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        They were laughing!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But of course you are still fired,&rdquo; Teddy said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So Parp took a month off, slept until two every afternoon, and dicked around in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen lifting weights and bitching about the &ldquo;state&rdquo; with his libertarian pals.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then when the month was over he got a call offering him a better paying job than the one he had with Teddy and <em>Teddy gave him a reference</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And Parp doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s strange!&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what he thinks he has coming to him!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Can ya feel the hate?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Can ya?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Okay, that was the jobs example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the sex example.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        We &mdash; me and Corrinne Junior and Parp and a friend of Junior&rsquo;s named Christine who Parp wanted to fuck &mdash; showed up one night at Cleopatra's Needle on Broadway.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The Needle is a jazz club with a horseshoe bar in the center and a gigantic TV screen hanging above it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound is turned down on the TV so you can watch hockey while listening to live jazz.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The Needle is always dark.&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't big.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of tables and the ones it has are all small, so when four people like me and Junior and Parp and Christine come in they have to slam two tables together.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So right at the beginning, we haven't ordered yet, Christine &mdash; who was this hot blonde forty year-old who spent all day on a treadmill &mdash; says to Parp, &ldquo;Hold on, hold on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's slow it down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ...&nbsp;&nbsp;you know ...&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a boyfriend.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And she gives him this big grin, like a hard plastic dome just dropped out of the ceiling to cover her and now she can&rsquo;t be touched.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Anyone else would have slowed down and gotten chatty, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, chicks have boyfriends.&nbsp;&nbsp; They might be interested in an eventual fuck-on-the-side, but if one says, &ldquo;Slow down, I need to size you up first&rdquo; then you slow down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, assuming you want to get it in her.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But not Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp; First he just stares at her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she looks down at her salad and starts back into the conversation they were having about politics.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now, I&rsquo;m watching this and I know that nothing good is about to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this because I see this look on Parp&rsquo;s face that I recognize from decades of Parp nuttiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s a look where you can see he isn't really listening to the conversation any more but to a stream of ideas making noise in his head.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the look a cat gets when it&rsquo;s just confirmed that yes, there <em>is</em>
        something moving in that corner.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Parp said after she got into why she's Green.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You just got done telling me that my skin isn't worth touching and you expect me to care what you think about the fucking wind farms on Cape Cod?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She stopped talking and leaned toward him like she hadn't heard him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept going.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don't care what you think about Obama or how your day went.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were fucking me maybe I would care, but what, I 'm going to listen to you talk, then I'm going to talk, then you're going to say, 'Oh look, eleven o'clock, gotta get home and blow my boyfriend before he dozes off'?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        For some reason Junior thought this was <em>really</em>
        funny, even though Christine was supposed to be her pal from someplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Tony?!</em>&rdquo; she said with this great big smile on her face.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Ball-tasting twat.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        At that point Parp, who never smiled during the whole thing, just stood up and put the napkin in his chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I'll settle up with you later, Paul,&rdquo; he said to me, the dramatic turd.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And then he turned around and walked for the door and everybody, I mean everybody sitting under the hockey and waiting for the jazz musicians to come off their break, watched him go.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Wait, wait ...&rdquo; Christine said as he went.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody watched him go all the way out, like it was a play and the curtain didn't fall until he was all the way out of sight.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When he was gone Christine turned around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face was burn red.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a fucking <em>asshole!</em>&rdquo; she said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then she got into an argument with Junior, who seemed to think that Parp had just busted her and she should take the busting like a grownup.&nbsp;&nbsp; They ended up laughing about it and the three of us agreed that Parp needed to get a lot less caffeine.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then a few days later Christine called up Junior and said she was busy dislocating her jaw on Parp's cock.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really pathetic about this,&rdquo; I said to Jessica the therapist when I told her the story.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Parp thinks she owes it to him to bend over and take his cock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like it&rsquo;s the least she can do.&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; And she does it!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I sat down and twisted my fingers around.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what I do when I don&rsquo;t have a cigarette to shake out of the pack.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know who I feel sorry for, Jess?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;The boyfriend.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica laughed and laughed.
    </div>
</div>
