        An Integral Part of the Plan
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You want your abs ripped, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, yeah.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You have to have maybe twelve percent body fat at most.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any more and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many crunches
        you do, the fat layer covers all the ripped muscle.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d know that, being a model.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What do you model, suits?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Oh yeah.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You get in shape, your prick gets in shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you take regular, large doses of vitamin B-12 and zinc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Massive
        hardons.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitamin B-12…&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t memorize.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get home I&rsquo;ll send you a list to your email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Probably
        not tonight, so don&rsquo;t wait up.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Okay, well… when you send it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let the subject have anything about dicks or hardons in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume
        anything you send to my home computer will be read in the Times Square by women wearing black veils and weeping.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it, &lsquo;Re: your gaffer tape question.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Thanks, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m kind of eager to try it all out.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Of course, if you put something in your body that hasn&rsquo;t been evaluated by the guns and badges then you could
        get one of those evil super-bugs that only people with guns and badges know about.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people
        in the cloth coats who clean up for a living?&nbsp;&nbsp;They should probably still be forced at the point of a gun
        to get a permission slip before they&rsquo;re allowed to make a decision for themselves, right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get all libertarian on me,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
        the people want to buy their own drugs, they should be allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just think they should be guaranteed
        that it&rsquo;s safe first.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp sighed this little laughy sigh that I guess was supposed to mean that he&rsquo;s Da Vinci and I&rsquo;m a clown.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about your sad, limp dick,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I could pretend that I remember the whole conversation word-for-word but what came next was...&nbsp;&nbsp;he told me to beat
        off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Pound your pud, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in those words.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like he was talking
        about football practice.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;re working out and taking the chemicals and doing the kegels,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said, &ldquo;you
        should pull your cock until you almost orgasm, then back off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do this a few times each day.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Each day?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get one of those rooms at the Commodore that Libby is always bragging he can use for an hour to bang
        Fat Fern.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to yank jasper without coming?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go nuts!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, no, no ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was enthused.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like we were in high school
        and he was telling me where I could buy beer any time I wanted, no I.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You <em>think</em>        you&rsquo;ll go crazy, but that goes away after about a minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you&rsquo;re ready to go again.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        only downside is you may do nothing else all day.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I have to tell you this goes against all my instincts.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He loped off toward the subway station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Going against your instincts is an integral part of the plan,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;he
        called back to me.
