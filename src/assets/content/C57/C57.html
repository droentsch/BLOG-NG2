        Pairs of Things
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I wanted two things at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;And those two things were complete opposites.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I hate it when that happens.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was just like this time when I was fifteen and I got a chance to be an apprentice at the Provincetown Shakespeare Festival
        one summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cool, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;Only I also met this girl &mdash; my first real girlfriend, Denise Jemsen, who
        I&rsquo;d just started having oral sex with and boy, did she know how to suck teenage cock.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <span class="c5">Remember back in that chapter when I told how Cammy gave head like she was born with a dick in her face? &nbsp;&nbsp;It
            was kind of like that with Denise. &nbsp;&nbsp;She bit pipe
            <em>eagerly</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;With no discernible reservations. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like nobody ever told her, &ldquo;Hey Denise listen: pretend you hate the
            taste of dick and that you&rsquo;re only putting it in your mouth because they really really want it and you
            feel sorry for them so you&rsquo;re going to do them this big favor and now they owe you one.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I really liked Denise Jemsen. &nbsp;&nbsp;And for years after we broke up and the only women I met were the ones pretending it
        was something they hated and that they were doing me a big favor and now I owed them one? &nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to look
        back on those days with Denise. &nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to do one of two things that summer: be an apprentice to this sort-of-famous Shakespeare troupe
        in Rhode Island, or stay home in Massachusetts and get blowjobs from Denise.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And I really wanted to do both.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I sent in my application to the Provincetown Shakespeare Festival and at the same time sort of assumed I&rsquo;d be rejected.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Because, well, rejection just happens more. &nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that even when I was a teenager. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
        life, right?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <span class="c5">So it was weird. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was gloomy about my inevitable rejection by the Provincetown company and excited by the thought
            of a summer of Denise blowjobs <em>at exactly the same time</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then when I heard back from the Provincetown Shakespeare Festival that they&rsquo;d love to have me because they got this
        really fantastic letter of recommendation from my English teacher and drama coach, Mr. Corcoran, I was really excited
        &mdash; and gloomy about missing out on a summer of Denise blowjobs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        At exactly the same time!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So like I said: I hate it when that happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in a situation where no matter how hard you
        try you&rsquo;re destined to miss out on something you really want, just because there are pairs of things out there
        that the universe says you can&rsquo;t have both of at once.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It&rsquo;s like philosophy or destiny or science or something.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You should read Aristotle, or a dumbed-down version of Aristotle that won&rsquo;t give your brain a hernia,&rdquo;
        Parp said years later when I told him my pairs-of-things-in-the-universe theory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He was all over that.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But when I told Jessica about telling Parp, she said, &ldquo;Aristotle was all about black and white. &nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the universe
        you live in? &nbsp;&nbsp;Black and white?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I decided I&rsquo;d be better off not telling people my theories anymore.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When I sat down to write the ol&rsquo; email to Cammy, I was thinking, &ldquo;Shit, here we go with the Denise Jemsen thing
        happening again for the jillionth time in my life.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to get in shape for a second date and bang
        Cammy till her ass bruised over, and at exactly the same time I was all gloomy about selling my soul to Parp and
        spending hours at the gym and not getting enough snacks.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        If I emailed Cammy now and she emailed me back soon I could end the suspense about what to feel down about and either avoid
        the Parp regimen entirely or start it right away.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Here&rsquo;s the email I ended up sending. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Camalot,</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Just thinking about the other night and all I can say is... bay-buh, bay-buh, bay-buh!</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em><span class="c5 c7">Yours,</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Daddy</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>PS &ndash; Shuck it like it&rsquo;s candy, little William.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        No kidding, I proofed that a good five times before hitting &ldquo;send.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty seconds later I wanted to blow
        my brains out.
    </div>
    <div class="body center">
        *******
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        By the way, here&rsquo;s what happened way back in high school with Denise Jemsen, in case you were wondering. &nbsp;&nbsp;Back
        when she was blowing me? &nbsp;&nbsp;I also had this best friend named Gerry who lived in this yellow house two streets
        away from me and whose dad was my mom&rsquo;s insurance agent and me being a teenager and therefore completely stupid?
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I told him all about Denise and the splentastic blowjobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;So about three weeks into my summer at the
        Provincetown Shakespeare Festival I heard from my sister Ellen that Denise was blowing the balls off Gerry and really
        not trying at all to keep it a secret. &nbsp;&nbsp;There was this one famous incident with her and Gerry and a jar of vodka
        at a party near a granite quarry. &mdash; To this day I don&rsquo;t know all the details. &nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently guys were
        lining up and parents were called.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I try not to think about it.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <span class="c5">It was depressing! &nbsp;&nbsp;And about a week before I heard about it we started rehearsing
            <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;and I was already depressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to play Puck but I was too tall so they cast me as Demetrius instead.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah, I know. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ninety-nine percent of you people reading this have no idea why that Demetrius/Puck thing would be depressing.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was! &nbsp;&nbsp;And it was a lot worse finding out my ex-best friend used insider information to get blowjobs
        from my now-ex-girlfriend.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And by the time summer was over she&rsquo;d dumped Gerry and moved on to blowing somebody I barely knew. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some fat kid
        with a whispy teen-beard who ran Bible club at the high school and had this low voice that sounded all compassionate
        and shit.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That was actually a little better, because it told me Denise must be crazy. &nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, she wanted fatty Bible fuzzy boy
        instead of Lord of All Tail.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The bitch was nuts!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And the guy who wrote me the glowing reference that got me into the Provincetown Shakespeare Festival? &nbsp;&nbsp;My English teacher
        and drama coach, Mr. Corcoran? &nbsp;&nbsp;He retired a few years later and ended up moving in with the guy who was the
        artistic director of that very same Provincetown Shakespeare Festival.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I like Mr. Corcoran and like I said: I&rsquo;m a liberal. &nbsp;&nbsp;But the thought of two geezers doing each other is&hellip;
        I dunno. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s two geezers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Doing each other.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Am I right?
    </div>
