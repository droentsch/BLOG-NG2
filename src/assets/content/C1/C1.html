        Revenge!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I just now decided I&rsquo;m writing this book for revenge.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Revenge works for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Technically?&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing this book is an assignment from my therapist, Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;ve been putting it off for the last couple weeks and going downstairs to this bar near my place called the Mermaid Inn.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s Summer so it&rsquo;s easy to just go out to the sidewalk and hang for a smoke between beers.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This book, writing this book, this assignment hanging over my head was like every other homework assignment I&rsquo;ve ever been given, all the way back to the original Evil Twat in my life, Mrs. Carol Marquette.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She was a Sunday School teacher.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The Evil Twat used to dig her chin into my shoulder when I owed her something and didn&rsquo;t deliver.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually this was shit I had to memorize, like the names of the twelve apostles or the books of the New Testament.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That&rsquo;s what popped into my head tonight when I was in front of the Mermaid, smoking, and looking across the street at this fenced-in playground, ten-thirty or so at night, before the revenge thing clicked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then it was like I woke up and said, &ldquo;Fuck this.&rdquo; &mdash; This doesn&rsquo;t have to be about my therapy, this can be about what I want it to be and I want it to be about <em>revenge</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to polish this or worry about publishing it, Paul.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is for <em>you</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But that was exactly wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want is <em>revenge</em>
        and to get revenge I pretty much have to get my story out there where it can break some glass.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And who do I want revenge on?&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much everybody at this point except of course the two boys &ndash; my two sons &ndash; Harry and Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a team.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Maybe not <em>everybody</em>
        else.&nbsp;&nbsp;But definitely on my wife, who stuck me with the kids so she could go spend a month in Southern California sucking the cock of the other person I definitely want to get revenge on:&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony Parp, the human turd.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It&rsquo;s justice, not just revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just thought of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all I&rsquo;m going to do is tell the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the truth about the cocksucker and the cocksuckee were pretty, well, then they&rsquo;d be proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it ain&rsquo;t pretty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get ready for it.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck yeah.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Between that last sentence and this one I ran downstairs to have another cigarette.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never lived much in my head so now I know what it&rsquo;s like to be all writery and have some idea making you get up and pace around and run downstairs and smoke and get a drink and then run back up and pace.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When I was down there I saw they were getting ready for one of those street fairs on Eighty-Eighth Street near Amsterdam, where I live.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can tell beause of the rolls of signage and the smell of cheap street meat, which is definitely not part of the normal Upper-West-Side-Near-Amsterdam ambience.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Anyway, when I was down there I thought up another reason why I like the revenge angle.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Namely, now I know where to begin the story.
