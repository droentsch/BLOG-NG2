        A Man Thing
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        About an hour after Cammy ran back into the
        theatre we were done shooting for the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And about a half hour 
        after <em>that</em>
        Parp and I were in a bar.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Her ass is almost perfect ...&rdquo; Parp
        said when I told him about Cammy and the cunt-framing.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It <em>is</em>
        perfect.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        There was this long pause while he stared at me
        and shook his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp was drinking soda water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, Budweiser.
        It&rsquo;s the king of beers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;How can you look at that ass and not be
        tempted to put your tongue in it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.E.D.,&rdquo; I said.
        &ldquo;While you&rsquo;re thinking about putting your tongue up a
        chick&rsquo;s ass, I think most men are thinking about putting
        their cocks up it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Cock.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a man
        thing.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to disappoint her in
        the rim job department.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if she really wants it and
        she&rsquo;s really made me come hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe then Daddy can
        butt-dive.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What, she should pretend I&rsquo;m
        thirty?&rdquo; I swallowed suds.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave me a look.
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that look.&nbsp;&nbsp;You think you&rsquo;re better
        than me because you like the taste of ass?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, let it be here noted that the blonde
        chick with the perfect ass framed her cunt at me, not you.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact,
        the only time your name came up was when she said she thought you
        might be gay.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Fuck that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say.&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it down to the
        no-cock-for-ladies vibe you give off.&nbsp;&nbsp;They get the sense that
        you&rsquo;re all face and no dick and the next thing you know the
        phrase &lsquo;probable pansy&rsquo; is crossing their
        minds.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I bet you eat cunt only grudgingly,&rdquo;
        he said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Not grudgingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely do it to be
        polite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes with gratitude, if she&rsquo;s already blown me.
        It&rsquo;s an exchange.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;A kind of mercantilism.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about <em>genitals</em>,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When you bang those up
        against each other it&rsquo;s a win-win.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re both there
        for the feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;But cunnilingus?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s more like
        a reward for a job well done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow me slow, I&rsquo;ll eat you
        slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me egg-beater head, I&rsquo;ll give you a quick peck on
        the clit.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you never crave
        eating a cunt?&nbsp;&nbsp;You never see a chick&rsquo;s legs slightly opened
        and think you&rsquo;d love to have that muff grinding off in your
        mouth?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I looked over at the bartender to see if I might
        be getting some moral support from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, a roll of the
        eyes or a little laugh to show Parp that yes, he is the freak, not
        me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But the bartender was down at the other end of
        the bar, leaning on it, on his elbows, talking to some brunette who
        brought her baby in with her, for Christ&rsquo;s sake.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The bartender seemed happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was his wife
        and kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she didn&rsquo;t make him watch while she gave birth
        to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t have those images in his head when it
        comes time to ball her.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;See, that
        &lsquo;I-crave-eating-cunt&rsquo; horseshit is horseshit,&rdquo; I
        said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone actually likes the taste of
        cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you maybe tell yourself you do to make having to eat
        it less of a chore, but you don&rsquo;t actually like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Think
        about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A disembodied cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any old cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears in front of
        you.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to eat that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;No, it definitely has to be embodied.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
        the body has to be pretty nice.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So you would agree it&rsquo;s not like
        craving a steak.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s still
        craving.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I had to have a smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;We took our drinks outside
        and I lit up.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, let me put it to you like
        this,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;After you&rsquo;ve frenched cunt,
        sucked clit, and so on, don&rsquo;t you run in and take a shower?
        At least wash your face real good?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I like to leave it on all
        day.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be serious,&rdquo; I
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I like to give the girl a piece of cloth
        to soak in the juice so I can carry it around and take hits off it
        throughout the day.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh yeah?&nbsp;&nbsp;I call bullshit.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Call whatever you want.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You fucking freak,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        gigcackled and took a drag off the dying cigarette.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So I guess by extension you&rsquo;re
        saying no woman really likes the taste of cock,&rdquo; he
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;By extension of what?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;By extension of the argument ...&nbsp;&nbsp;the <em>reasoning</em>
        that eating cunt is a favor you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
        givin&rsquo; thang.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not making this up kids, he
        said &ldquo;thang.&rdquo; See what I put up with?&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like
        having a friend who says &ldquo;nigger.&rdquo;)
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He said: &ldquo;No man likes the taste of cunt,
        ergo no woman likes the taste of cock.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I lit up another one and took that first gorgeous
        puff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He seemed surprised.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different with chicks and
        dicks.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s that whole penis-envy thing and the whole human
        phallus fascination.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp;See, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to
        understand this.&nbsp;&nbsp;You live in this good-and-evil, black-and-white,
        symmetrical world and reality isn&rsquo;t always that
        cut-and-dried.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s more nuanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t follow
        that because all men are genetically revolted by the taste of
        snatch that all women hate the taste of dick.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s the
        whole psychology and anthropology thing you have to think
        about.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that when you eat a
        woman out you&rsquo;re doing her a favor, but when she sucks your
        cock you&rsquo;re just giving her what she wants.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s psychology and
        anthropology,&rdquo; I said again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have been getting a
        little peeved here.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain things you&rsquo;re supposed
        to know as grown-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re supposed to read certain books.
        Magazines.&nbsp;&nbsp;When people don&rsquo;t read those things, then what?
        It&rsquo;s up to me to fill them in on all the why&rsquo;s?&nbsp;&nbsp;Come
        on.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what I mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s psychology and anthropology.
        I&rsquo;m supposed to give Parp a crash course in both right now on
        a sidewalk outside a bar because he doesn&rsquo;t know about women
        and penis?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You have to know that there are women who
        believe the exact opposite,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are women
        who are convinced that men think eating them is the main event, and
        that no woman really craves the taste of dick.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the female
        Pauls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paulines.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;The Paulines,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are
        dykes.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We went back into the bar and Parp got Coke Zero.
        I got a St.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauli Girl.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey Tony,&rdquo; I said at the bar.
        &ldquo;I gotta big favor to ask.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You gotta let me come to the shoot
        tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So come.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;But I have to have something to do, be
        part of the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t just be hanging around for her,
        you know how that would look.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Like you want to fuck her as much as you
        want to fuck her.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her to think that,
        though.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to have the idea that hey, I&rsquo;m getting
        plenty, but I&rsquo;m always willing to try out a
        rookie.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, then show up, there&rsquo;ll be
        plenty to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you know what, in fact?&nbsp;&nbsp;You could get the coffee
        and donuts for breakfast.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Then breakfast is over and why am I
        there?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You can be a driver.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
        can&rsquo;t just be lugging stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t be in a position
        where I could conceivably get yelled at and have to take it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        should be in a position where I could conceivably yell at someone 
        and <em>they</em>
        should have to take it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You want to be a producer.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;would be
        righteous.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I swigged some Girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, producer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have
        thought of that before, when I was fighting with Junior.
        &ldquo;Gotta go, hon, I&rsquo;m a producer.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, well, producers generally make more
        of an investment,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I know, but, this isn&rsquo;t really being
        a producer,&rdquo; I kind of chuckled.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you mean
        that to be a producer on this I have to put money in?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You could donate your actor-time.&nbsp;&nbsp;How
        about that?&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me the check you get from SAG in a few days and
        we&rsquo;ll call you a producer.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I said.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to bring that check home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior knows
        I&rsquo;ve got this gig, and she&rsquo;s going to expect that
        check.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, we&rsquo;re trying to raise a family
        here.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp just sipped his Coke.&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t give
        a fuck about my family.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;getting
        that check is such a sense of validation for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know?&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes
        me feel like I&rsquo;m really doing what I said I would do when I
        grew up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really need that check.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Having to explain all this was starting to annoy
        me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&rsquo;m his friend, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp;&nbsp;He
        can&rsquo;t just tell people I&rsquo;m a producer so I can look
        good for a chick I want to fuck?&nbsp;&nbsp;Asshole.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you
        want to do?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        <em>What do I want to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;Fucking fuck-faced
            fuckhead!&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you tell people I&rsquo;m a producer!
            Shit!</em>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;See, she knows you&rsquo;re an actor
        already,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s she going to think,
        you&rsquo;re a producer who acts?&nbsp;&nbsp;An actor who produces?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
        weren&rsquo;t you a producer today?&nbsp;&nbsp;How am I going to work,
        &lsquo;FYI, Paul&rsquo;s a producer&rsquo; into the conversation?
        You don&rsquo;t think Bobby&rsquo;s going to want to see your
        investment?&nbsp;&nbsp;Something tangible?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fair point,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We sucked drink in silence for awhile.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;By the way, Cameron may be somebody you
        can get work from,&rdquo; he said eventually.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cammy the employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boss
            Camsta</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the artistic director of the
        Milestone Theatre Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re doing a staged reading of <em>Democracy My Ass</em>
        in about six weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the company likes
        the reading, they&rsquo;ll probably mount the full production this
        summer.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;And Cameron is the artistic
        director?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She knows literature and shit?&rdquo; I
        looked back on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;She really didn&rsquo;t seem like an artistic
        director.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her ass is super tight, like she almost never sits on it.
        Plus she wants a rim job.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to seem
        condescending,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was talking over your head all
        afternoon.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah, right, like you were there,&rdquo; I
        gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was a forced gigcackle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking two
        things at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Parp is always putting me down like
        that, like I&rsquo;m stupid or something, and I&rsquo;m this far
        from telling him I think it&rsquo;s uncalled-for.&nbsp;&nbsp;And second, what 
        if she <em>was</em>
        talking over my head?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if that whole riff
        on my laugh had references to pop culture or a new play and I just
        didn&rsquo;t know and now she&rsquo;s pretty sure I&rsquo;m stupid
        or a square?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So what
        about the photographer and you?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Bay-<em>leen</em>-da,&rdquo; he
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Bet she wasn&rsquo;t talking over your
        head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhhhh???&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahahahaha ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s a babe but she was just
        taking pictures.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hire her for the
        bend-over potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, did you see that waist-to-ass
        ratio?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You should see her with her pants
        down,&rdquo; Parp said, and he gave me this little grin that makes
        you want to bash out his teeth.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I was crestfallen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of all tail hates hearing 
        this shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Sure he fucked her</em>, I thought quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>But
            she hadn&rsquo;t met me yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she&rsquo;d seen me first then
            shit, we&rsquo;d&mdash;</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s naked on the Internet,&rdquo;
        Parp said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You fucked a naked Internet
        chick?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Relax, cunt-master.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t fuck
        anybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just saw her naked on the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how I
        found her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has this photo blog and she poses naked for it.
        Sexy.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        What a relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This has nothing to do with 
        my <em>droit-de-seigneur</em>
        complex,&rdquo; I lied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was
        just interested because hey, she has this nice big butt and
        it&rsquo;s on the Internet.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big one all
        right.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Can you send me the link?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He hesitated.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he made one of those faces 
        &ndash; like an exaggerated wince &ndash; that said, <em>Oh shit I
            really don&rsquo;t want to</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; I asked.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a naked chick on the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re
        sharing with your bud.&nbsp;&nbsp;I might even get interested in the blog part
        of it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, look.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll send you the link
        but like, don&rsquo;t send it to anyone else in the shoot or tell
        anybody what I just said, all right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Seems a little paranoid.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to get back to her.
        I hired her for the photography and I don&rsquo;t want her thinking
        that I&rsquo;m going around telling my &lsquo;buds&rsquo; where
        they can go to see her butt-crack.&nbsp;&nbsp;That might make her think
        she&rsquo;s here because she&rsquo;s a novelty instead of a, you 
        know, <em>colleague</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah, I guess I get it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Tell me you&rsquo;ll keep it a secret,
        okay?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe with me,&rdquo; I said.
        &ldquo;So what about that producer thing?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just say I&rsquo;m a
        producer, huh?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are
        real producers on that set, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are investing in
        the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly time, but a couple put money in too.&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I
        tell them, that you&rsquo;re a producer because you really want to
        impress somebody so she&rsquo;ll be easier to fuck?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Fuck that,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do
        you have to tell them anything?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Because they&rsquo;ll ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t
        you?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were kicking in something in exchange for a producer
        credit and somebody else was getting the credit just because they
        were my chum, wouldn&rsquo;t you want to know what the reason
        was?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t like I want a final
        credit or anything,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just want to be, you 
        know, <em>called</em>
        a producer for a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, how is that
        going to hurt anything?&nbsp;&nbsp;Producer for a day?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was getting 
        steamed, which was starting to get <em>me</em>
        steamed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean,
        I&rsquo;m asking for a tiny favor here, and after I gave up a day
        with my family so I could be a fucking walk-on on in his dinky little
        video.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You want to be called a producer because it&rsquo;s a
        big deal and it will impress Cameron.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if it wasn&rsquo;t a
        big deal, it wouldn&rsquo;t impress her, right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I fumed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender wandered close and had an
        ear cocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pretending to be checking out the
        stack of checks at the cash register, but I knew he was listening
        in.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Right?&rdquo; Parp asked again.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I just want a
        tiny favor and you&rsquo;re going to make me do what, beg for
        it?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done talking,&rdquo; he
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He stood up, threw some bills on the bar, and
        walked out.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The bartender watched him go out and then looked
        at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wound a little tight, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he
        asked.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
</div>
