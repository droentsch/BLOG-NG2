	<div class="chapterSubhead">My Ride with Big-Butt</div>
	<div class='body'>Big-butt Belinda was pretty surprised when I
		let it slip that Parp was physically deformed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean,
		I&rsquo;m pretty sure when ladies fantasize about blowing a guy they
		picture him having all of his fingers and toes.</div>
	<div class='body'>I felt sorry for the sloth.&nbsp;&nbsp; No
		fooling.&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t his fault he was born with a foot
		that looks like a talon, but hey, even really hard pecs won&rsquo;t
		stop a girl from puking when she looks down at the end of the bed and
		counts...and recounts...and realizes she&rsquo;s lying next to
		something that would have been burned at the stake in simpler times.</div>
	<div class='body'>I&rsquo;m not saying those were good
		times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those days back when Parp would have been lit on
		fire in a public place. I&rsquo;m just saying that generally chicks
		don&rsquo;t fantasize about blowing devil-boy.</div>
	<div class='body'>(There are freakish exceptions to that
		rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife, for example.)</div>
	<div class='body'>Big-butt: &ldquo;Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Really?&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not kidding?&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine
		toes?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Me: &ldquo;Yeah, the chick he&rsquo;s with now?
		She&rsquo;s got some weight problems so I guess she figures it&rsquo;s
		a trade-off.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Big-butt: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a
		girlfriend?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Me: &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s his girlfriend.
		Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t call her that.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked out the window
		at the funeral homes whizzing past.</div>
	<div class='body'>For the record &mdash; and because I&rsquo;m
		being absolutely truthful in this tale of revenge and justice &mdash;
		Parp didn&rsquo;t actually have this other chick in his
		life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made her up on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty
		smooth, right?</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Don&rsquo;t be acting all shocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know anything
		about me by now &mdash; if I&rsquo;ve gone out of my way to tell you
		anything about me &mdash; it&rsquo;s that I need to be lord of all
		tail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cock-blocking is more than just a reflex with me,
		and slightly less than a <em>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</em>.
		That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m in therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to
		deal with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to be a better person and
		usually I am. But see Parp sent me out on this errand when he knew all
		I wanted was my Cammy, and she didn&rsquo;t show up so now he thought
		he could make me into his gofer and besides: I had to talk about <em>something</em>
		on the ride back from Long Island, didn&rsquo;t I?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He looks like Iggy Pop,&rdquo; she
		giggled.</div>
	<div class='body'>I wasn&rsquo;t ready to change the subject.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&ldquo;I bet Iggy has ten toes though.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She kind of shut up after that and stared out the window some
		more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could smell her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had this scent of
		almond mint coming off her, probably off her hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almond
		mint, just like Junior&rsquo;s ex-hooker gal-pal Sue
		Gasparino.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was right about then that I started to
		wonder whether big-butt Belinda was game for a roadside
		fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Swear to God, it started out as an innocent
		speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp; A rumination on the evidence at
		hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, I knew she posed naked on the
		Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place, I knew she was wearing
		jeans so low-cut I could practically see snatch cleavage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		So how could I <em>not</em> wonder if she was just waiting for an
		invitation to pull over and slam for awhile?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if she
		was telegraphing it to me so hard she was vibrating and I was just too
		damn dopey to pick it up?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if she&rsquo;s sitting
		there thinking, <em>What the fuck is he waiting for?</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>And then the old, dark suspicion set
		in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient male suspicion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Primordial,
		even.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the ooze, male lizards suspected they
		might be banging a lot more female lizard ass if only they spoke up
		more and weren&rsquo;t so afraid of getting shot down.</div>
	<div class='body'>Like I said, that suspicion?&nbsp;&nbsp; That
		suspicion that goes back so far it&rsquo;s branded on our
		DNA?&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt it creeping up on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the next
		thing I knew I was opening my mouth and shit was flying out.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Parp tells me he found you on the Internet one night while he
		was browsing for porn,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Says your ass is fan-<em>tab</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He said what?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Fantabulous.&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
		use that word, though.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pretty much my
		word.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She got really flustered, which I was
		completely unprepared for.&nbsp;&nbsp; She started to talk a few times
		but cut herself off before she could get out more than an
		&ldquo;um&mdash;&rdquo; or &ldquo;sh&mdash;&rdquo; or some other sound
		that wasn&rsquo;t a whole word.</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled to try to make it seem like I was
		harmless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I couldn&rsquo;t have meant I&rsquo;d like
		to see her ass up close and bent over.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;What are you <em>laughing</em> at?!&rdquo; she finally
		asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, well, I hope you liked my <em>ass</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hey, it isn&rsquo;t <em>me,</em> Bindy!&rdquo; I
		pled.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about your ass,
		it&rsquo;s Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp; He just told me about it.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh right.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeh-<em>esssss</em>!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d taken the time to see the pictures
		yourself then maybe you would have realized they&rsquo;re <em>art</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Classic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at her big naked butt makes me an
		asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, not looking at her big naked
		butt makes me an asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile she&rsquo;s missing
		the entire obvious point that <em>Parp</em> is the asshole for going
		around telling people her ass is sweet so check it out.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I decided to play the mature card.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I said, my voice getting
		all low and adult, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m the father of
		two pre-teen boys and sometimes they ask me questions about my friends
		and I&rsquo;m, well, not always sure what to say to them.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Um, I thought&mdash;I thought you said
		this was because Parp said my ass was fan-tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
		it&rsquo;s your kids?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Sometimes they make you earn the mature card.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I was using Tony as a jumping off
		point,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was kind of terse, you
		know?&nbsp;&nbsp; The way mature people are when they&rsquo;re
		disappointed you weren&rsquo;t mature enough to understand them the
		first time.</div>
	<div class='body'>It was quiet for a sec, then she said:
		&ldquo;Okay, what kinds of questions do your kids ask that make you
		have to tell me how fan-tab my ass is on the Internet?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m an actor and a
		model.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a lot of artist friends who participate in
		activities that a couple of very young boys wouldn&rsquo;t understand,
		so I ask for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And also -&rdquo; I chuckled here
		&ldquo;- for myself.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, in your case, I&rsquo;d like to be
		able to tell them how a photgraphic artist decides to become her own
		nude portraiture subject.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;How old are your kids?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Seven and four.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it just be easier to tell
		them not to browse the Internet before they&rsquo;re old enough to
		reach the keyboard?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I chuckled serenely at the snide twat.
		&ldquo;Point taken,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>That just sort of hung there in the air for a
		few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; She cleared her throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
		sure she was going to tell me I was full of horseshit, but instead she
		said: &ldquo;So what are your kids&rsquo; names?&rdquo; and we got
		onto a conversation about the fam.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought for a few
		minutes that there might still be some cunt in it for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I thought maybe the mature card turned her on.&nbsp;&nbsp; It says
		I&rsquo;m stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophisticated, even.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe
		she and Cammy talked about me last night on their ride back to Long
		Island.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe they both have fantasies about doing married
		men.</div>
	<div class='body'>But no such luck.&nbsp;&nbsp; We fam-talked for
		awhile and then suddenly the subject shifted to her childhood in
		Nassau County and how she wanted to be a photographer since she was
		eight and her Uncle Jeffrey gave her an old polaroid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
		we had to talk about her cool boyfriend and how they live together in
		the little house with the pit bull and how the pit bull stares at them
		every morning while the cool boyfriend eats her out.</div>
	<div class='body'>(That&rsquo;s right, I can&rsquo;t bring up the
		subject of her ass because that might signify I have one of those
		disgusting male libidos, but she can blithely mention that she comes
		in her boyfriend&rsquo;s face every morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ladies, if
		this game had rules there would be flags all over the field.)</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh, and get this, she&rsquo;s a libertarian,
		like Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re in favor of legalizing marijuana?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeppers.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Me too, but I&rsquo;m just a lowly
		Democrat.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Democrat, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp; So that means
		you think the poor should be protected from the marijuana
		agribusiness, right?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;If marijuana is legalized,
		right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll have a whole bunch of growers and
		sellers out there and each of &lsquo;em is going to want you to buy
		their marijuana. Think they should just be allowed to do
		that?&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, put profits before people?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, I think that they should be
		strictly regulated of course.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> you do,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, my
		friends, her contempt for my reasonable views just oozed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&ldquo;And the FDA should have to approve all the weed before anyone
		gets to smoke it first, right?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&ldquo;Interesting. Ha!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ya know, I remember once in
		Syracuse we were scoring a bag...&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I thought the reminiscence would throw her off
		the scent, and it did, thank God.&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked about pot and
		pot-smoking and how Parp and Vider used to just sit there and never
		smoke it, just pass it to the next person, sober as wet clams while
		everyone else giggled.</div>
	<div class='body'>She was curious about Parp and Vider and
		Whispers and how they all got together, and what their stories
		were.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her Whispers was married to Mondi McDade, and
		then I had to tell her who Mondi McDade was.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
		remember 1981?&rdquo; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Um, I actually wasn&rsquo;t <em>born</em> in 1981.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Oh, well, but you know the song, <em>Not on the Hood of My
			Car</em>, right?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Mmm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Well she wrote that and it was recorded by her group Blynx,
		which was pretty hot back then.&nbsp;&nbsp; They used it in the
		soundtrack to the movie <em>Surviving Chappaqua High</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh, I saw that movie.&nbsp;&nbsp; What
		was the name of the song?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;<em>Not on the Hood of My Car</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Pause.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her arm lurch as it
		started to reach for the non-existent radio, then aborted.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you never heard of
		Mondi McDade.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
		she kind of giggled a scoffing giggle.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
		take your word for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobby&rsquo;s
		married to a rock star.&nbsp;&nbsp; What about Tony and George
		Vider?&nbsp;&nbsp; How did they hook up?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>So I told her how Parp and me and Vider went to
		school together.&nbsp;&nbsp; How when Parp and Vider got out they did
		a summer at a resort doing a mind-reading act.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;
		Parp was the mind-reader, Vider worked the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
		later they came to New York and Parp started up a theatre company and
		Vider did comedy.</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s where Vider met Bobby Whispers, in
		the comedy clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whispers was a member of a four-man
		comedy troupe called Max Yux.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t that great a
		performer but Vider liked his material so Whispers ended up writing
		for Vider after Max Yux split up over who got to fuck their one
		groupie.</div>
	<div class='body'>Vider&rsquo;s career really took off after
		that. Then, like I mentioned before, came the night when he froze in
		front of Letterman&rsquo;s microphone.&nbsp;&nbsp; That by itself
		didn&rsquo;t kill him, but his confidence was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
		couldn&rsquo;t get a laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other comics would sit at the
		bar watching him and wincing while he choked.</div>
	<div class='body'>While Vider was on the upswing, Whispers was
		living large.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; New apartment, rock-star girlfriend,
		leather blazer for every day of the week.</div>
	<div class='body'>So when Vider&rsquo;s career exploded, Whispers
		was kind of caught holding a scotch and looking stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
		might have tried some stand-up himself but right around then his old
		man died and left him the tobacco shop on Sixth Avenue.</div>
	<div class='body'>Suddenly his dayjob was making sure porkchops
		in suits got fresh fat cigars.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Vider&rsquo;s been in therapy ever
		since,&rdquo; I told big-butt.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s been
		making a comeback on cable shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve got HBO
		you&rsquo;ve maybe seen a couple specials he&rsquo;s done.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		But he mainly performs at his club now.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;And the place we&rsquo;re going today,
		that&rsquo;s Vider&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yep, and Whispers is directing and Parp
		wrote it and I&rsquo;m producing.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh, whoopee-doo,&rdquo; she said, with a
		petulance that came out of nowhere.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was too tired to fight with it, so we rode in
		silence for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before we got to Manhattan she
		started taking pictures of me and giggling and I said, &ldquo;Now you
		stop that!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>You know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Playfully.</em></div>
	<div class='body'>
		I still can&rsquo;t figure out exactly where the turning point
		was.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know?&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact point where she decided,
		&ldquo;Nope, no cock in <em>this</em> car.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>But to this day I try to figure it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The male lizard in me needs to know.</div>
</div>
