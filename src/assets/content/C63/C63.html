    <div class="body">
        Yeah. &nbsp;I was dancing around the morning I found the Cammy email in my inbox. &nbsp;But I knew I was going to have to
        get serious.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And pronto.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Right after dropping the boys off at school I phoned up the Dark Lord and told him my soul was his.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Start taking the vitamins on the list I sent you,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then find someplace private and start
        training Mr. Balls, or whatever you call him.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Roger that,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know what, in fact? &nbsp;Does Fern Mendez still work at the Commodore? &nbsp;Because you know what Libby says&hellip;&rdquo;

    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah, I knew. &nbsp;And I knew Fern Mendez &mdash; a.k.a. &ldquo;Fat Fern&rdquo; &mdash; pretty well already. &nbsp;I know
        a lot of people who work at the Commodore. &nbsp;Sometimes when I hang out with Libby it&rsquo;s in the Commodore
        lounge and one of the lounge regulars was Fat Fern, laughing and tossing back mojitos.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Fern was a chambermaid and pretty famous for making the male members of the staff feel extra special. &nbsp;In the manly
        fashion. &nbsp;On demand.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, you can count on the chambermaids in a hotel to know where an empty room is at any given time. &nbsp;And if one of them
        is so inclined? &nbsp;She can take you to that room on her work break and fuck your brains out.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And Fern was famous for being so inclined.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I got word to Libby that I wanted to hook up with Fern and he got back to me that same afternoon.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Fern says she would
        <em>love</em>
        &nbsp;to meet you,&rdquo; Libby said. &nbsp;&ldquo;In the
        <em>lounge</em>
        .&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I didn&rsquo;t know how to take that.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She&rsquo;d <em>love</em> &nbsp;to meet me? &nbsp;Was she being sarcastic?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And in the <em>lounge?</em> &nbsp;Why not in one of the rooms?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I had to think back on how I left it with Fern the last time we hooked up.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I sounded out the memory and it seemed good. &nbsp;I remembered that back when I saw Fern a few times about two years before
        she was game. &nbsp;Round the clock. &nbsp;But she was real busy and never had a lot of free time she could put together
        at once. &nbsp;So the sex was really quick and basic and you never had all your clothes off.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Back then we had three afternoon encounters and it was over. &nbsp;We never hooked up again. &nbsp;Almost simultaneously
        me and Junior stopped having the big fight that sort of shoved me in Fern&rsquo;s direction, and Fern started seeing
        Jonno and didn&rsquo;t want to be disloyal to him even though Jonno was married which meant he was being disloyal
        to Fern by definition.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So that was the short and sweet of my past with Fern. &nbsp;And last April? &nbsp;Before the Cammy email came and I called
        up Libby? &nbsp;The only times I ever saw Fern was when we were both in the Commodore lounge hanging out with the
        rest of the staff.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then after I phoned up Libby and he said Fern would love to meet in the lounge I went down to meet her and she was all smiley
        with me. &nbsp;After some really small small-talk she grabbed me by the left hand and took me straight up to Room
        882 where I sat her down on the edge of the bed and told her how I needed to work myself through increasing stages
        of arousal over and over and that she could be a big help by bringing me right to the edge without, you know, finishing.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I repeated it for her in case she misunderstood what I was up to.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ultimately the goal is that I should get just as aroused as I normally would, but without...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Finishing.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Wow. &nbsp;So you can do that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Not yet. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I need your help. &mdash; If you&rsquo;re willing.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And you doing all this for a girl just so you can jam her longer?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;As long as possible. &nbsp;Or until she screams, &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Fern looked sad for a sec. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I wish <em>I</em> &nbsp;was that girl.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I was standing right in front of her. &nbsp;I looked down at her and stroked the ultra-black hair on the side of her head.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Jesus Fern, I thought you and Jonno were kind of a thing.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Nahhhh,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jonno he back jamming his wife. &nbsp; He get all guilty &lsquo;cuz me I was
        blowing him every day and soon he start jamming my culo. &nbsp;And he do it slow and suave. &nbsp;But he get way
        guilty and tell me we have to stop.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I felt really close to her right then.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sorry to hear that, Fern,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;She sniffled. &nbsp;I sat down next to her on the bed. &nbsp;&ldquo;He kep&rsquo; tellin&rsquo;
        me he want to take me out on the beach in Puerto Rico and jam me suave. &nbsp;You know. &nbsp;In the culo. &nbsp;He
        like saying that. &nbsp;I like thinking about it. &nbsp;We might still do it, I think. &nbsp;When he get tired of
        his wife again then we go to Puerto Rico and I lie on a blanket on the beach and take Jonno suave.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying the word &lsquo;suave&rsquo;, right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;I using it wrong?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It mean gentle.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        A few seconds later she was sucking me frantically. &nbsp;Almost in a &nbsp;panic. &nbsp;Like she lost an heirloom inside
        my penis.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I failed to control myself.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; I said as I lay on my back when it was over. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a lot harder than I thought.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She giggled.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I have a theory,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;I was trying to distance myself. &nbsp;Be objective. &nbsp;Scientific. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
        going to say hypothetically it&rsquo;s a matter of timing. &nbsp;I have to know I&rsquo;m about to erupt, then hold
        it back at exactly that moment.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t feel it about to happen?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I did but it was all over before I could remember how to use those muscles. &nbsp;The hold-it-back muscles.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well we go again tomorrow? &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be free? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She sat up on the bed and stroked my cheek. &nbsp;Suave. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your coach!&rdquo; she said in an excited
        whisper. &nbsp;&ldquo;From now till your fuck date? &nbsp;Every lunchtime which is same as today, five o&rsquo;clock.
        &nbsp;You want to meet Mondays and Thursdays too?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She was off Mondays. &nbsp;I was off Thursdays. &nbsp;It was something to think about. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tempting,
        Fern,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think I can swing Thursdays. &nbsp;We should maybe use those
        days to rest up.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I &nbsp;sat up and stared in her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Fern,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;What if Jonno...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ahhhh,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &lsquo;bout him. &nbsp;He jamming his wife right now. &nbsp;Hard.
        &nbsp;Like at a rodeo. &nbsp;If he want me in the next three weeks he can make a appointment for dinner break.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She squeezed my arm.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Lunch is Paulie,&rdquo; she said.
