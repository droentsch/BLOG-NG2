	<div class="chapterSubhead">Why Chicks Dig Me Sometimes: A Theory</div>
	<div class='body'>I know what you&rsquo;re
		thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Paunchy guy with
		toothpick arms and a stupid laugh and a lousy job and this is two days
		in a row some chick is offering to help you with that nasty
		bulge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp is right: What&rsquo;s the attraction?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Hey, I&rsquo;m almost as surprised as you
		are.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you could say it&rsquo;s the
		married-guy-is-ass-bait phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, but I&rsquo;m
		pretty skeptical.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I wish that&rsquo;s the way
		chicks worked but like you saw on the ride with big-butt Belinda,
		being married doesn&rsquo;t automatically make a babe want to blow
		you.</div>
	<div class='body'>In fact if you took every other day of my life
		as a guide you&rsquo;d probably conclude it doesn&rsquo;t attract
		hardly any of them.</div>
	<div class='body'>I have my own personal theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;An
		alternative one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paulie hypothesis on why babes want me
		sometimes and not other times.</div>
	<div class='body'>Here it is: For around three-hundred and fifty
		days a year I&rsquo;m a bartender and a husband and a
		father.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reality is I&rsquo;m completely out of
		place in that world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole reason for me to be in New
		York is to be around actors and theatres and cameras.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		dreamed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I trained for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s why
		I&rsquo;m in the City.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s where I met my wife.</div>
	<div class='body'>So it&rsquo;s my element.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for
		maybe one month out of every year &mdash; two or three back when I was
		really working at it &mdash; I get to be in my element.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
		when I&rsquo;m in my element I find that the babes do respond.</div>
	<div class='body'></div>
	<div class='body'>Or maybe it&rsquo;s the married
		thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe actresses and dancers more than any other
		class of female take a perverse pleasure in blowing married
		guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s just show biz.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
		art.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mabye art is a perversion or maybe it just hates
		things like marriages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe marriages are a perversion,
		like business suits.&nbsp;&nbsp;How the fuck should I know?</div>
