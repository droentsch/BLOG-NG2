		The Inaugural Ball
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The Inaugural Ball. &nbsp;What a relief, feeling the sunlight on my face after twenty years in the wifetail mines. &nbsp;Even now when I think back on it? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like the long, deep breath of summer breeze you imagine floating through a lanai off some Hawaiian beach.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Actually, it&rsquo;s like a couple things. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also like a roller-coaster&hellip; wait. &nbsp;Erase that from your brain. &nbsp;Picture this: you&rsquo;re in a roller coaster at the very beginning of the ride, when it&rsquo;s getting the long crank up to that first steep plunge. &nbsp;You know how when you just get over the top there&rsquo;s that moment of weightlessness where the rollercoaster drops out from under you but gravity hasn&rsquo;t got hold of you yet? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve come up from the depths and you&rsquo;re about to go crashing down into them again but for a split second you&rsquo;re floating.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Okay, now imagine that right in the heart of that split-second you get a nice warm Hawaiian breeze and an orgasm. &mdash; Then boom! It&rsquo;s over and you&rsquo;re plummeting toward the pavement hoping you can keep irresistible forces of nature from twisting your head off your neck.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		That&rsquo;s what the Inaugural Ball was like.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But I get ahead of myself. &nbsp;Let me recount the story as it happened. &nbsp;Just remember. &nbsp;For a brief moment? &nbsp;Night in Hawaii. &nbsp;No matter how bleak the rest of it might sound, for a minute at least it was like lying on linen under zephyrs.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		First I think you should know that the Roundabout Inn is not a dive. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a respectable hotel where respectable people go to ball the significant others of others. &nbsp;It has a bar and nice furnishings and a lobby. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t massive and expensive like the Hilton or the Hyatt or the Sheraton or the Commodore, but still. &nbsp;Nice is nice.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Because you don&rsquo;t want the girl to feel like a tramp. &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s not right. &nbsp;I guess if you ask some people &mdash; like people on the periphery of the porn industry or who keep blogs on Tumblr &mdash; they&rsquo;ll tell you making the girl feel like a tramp isn&rsquo;t bad like it used to be. &nbsp;Okay, let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s true. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s definitely bad though is making her feel like a tramp in a place that smells like the mattress was flipped over to hide the ass-shaped brown stain. &nbsp;A place where you have to get drinks from a machine on the cement terrace. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s not so hot.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So I was pretty relieved when I got to the Roundabout and saw how nice it was inside. &nbsp;I took the elevator up to the ninth floor which was all hush with thick walls and carpeting so you couldn&rsquo;t hear your stick tap if you were a blind guy.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was feeling pretty good. &nbsp;I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror and whoa: not bad. &nbsp;Denim jacket over my shoulder and a button-down shirt and dockers hid my skinny arms and paunch, at least for the time being, and I thought: <em>Hey. &nbsp;Shirt on. &nbsp;Maybe she&rsquo;ll like a shirt-on balling.</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When I got up to the door I could see some yellow papers stuck to the metal plate that connected the key card lock and the door handle.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When I got closer I could see that they were postit notes. &nbsp;Five of them. &nbsp;With big blue ink-lettered words that read:
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		PAUL,
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		DO <span style="text-decoration: underline">NOT</span>&nbsp;BREAK CHARACTER
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		YOURS,
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<del>CAMMY</del>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		BILLY
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Billy?</em>&nbsp; Hm. &nbsp;<em>Maybe that&rsquo;s her nom de cunt for the evening</em>, I thought. &nbsp;I was pretty sure though that chicks named &ldquo;Billie&rdquo; spelled it with an I-E. &nbsp;Bill<em>ie</em>&nbsp;Jean. &nbsp;Bill<em>ie</em>&nbsp;Sue.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Whatever. &nbsp;Okay, so I call her Billie and I don&rsquo;t break character. &nbsp;I was pretty sure &ldquo;don&rsquo;t break character&rdquo; was just her polite way of saying, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do your stupid laugh.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I straightened up from reading the postits and rapped &ldquo;taps&rdquo; against the door.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>knock knock-knock</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>knock knock-knock</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I thought I heard a giggle from way inside and a couple seconds later the door opened a crack and half a Cammyface looked around the corner so she could see me but I could only see one of her eyeballs. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait a sec,&rdquo; her voice said. &nbsp;Then I heard a chuckle and footsteps running away into the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay Daddy, you can come in now!&rdquo; she called in a funny little voice.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When I walked in she was kneeling on the bed and fuck, her ass was <em>perfect</em>. &nbsp;Even later when I&rsquo;d had it in my face for a while it did not quit. &nbsp;She was gym-and-diet girl, and had these muscles even where I didn&rsquo;t know muscles existed. &nbsp;Not big, beefed-up muscles, but hard cuts without an ounce of fat on them.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Boys, I was a little intimidated.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But here&rsquo;s what threw me. &nbsp;Just a bit. &nbsp;She was wearing this school uniform with tight black dress pants, a white shirt, a little clip-on necktie, and black patent-leather shoes.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She was kneeling on the bed, facing away from me, and leaning forward on her hands so that if she&rsquo;d shifted her weight forward a little she would have been on all fours.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Picture it. &nbsp;Her back is arched so her ass is aimed right <em>at</em>&nbsp;me. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s covered by these tight black pants that can barely contain the bulge of her cunt lips, not to mention her ass cheeks. &nbsp;I could see her black bra-strap through her little white shirt, and &mdash; when she turned her head to look at me over her shoulder &mdash; that red-glossed mouth under long darkened lashes&hellip;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She gave me this big, open-mouth smile.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Admiral Ballsy should have jolted at that moment, but he reeled instead, like he&rsquo;d been hit with a phaser on stun.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I walked over to her and let my denim jacket slide down to the floor. &nbsp;Hey. &nbsp;Casual, right? &nbsp;But then I had an instant flash that it might be a breach of suavecorum, I so I bent over to get it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Make Mommy get it later, Daddy,&rdquo; she giggled.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I gigcackled. &nbsp;She looked away. &nbsp;Whoops.
	</div>
