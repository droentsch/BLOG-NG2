        Wake Up Call

        I was on my way home that night &ndash; right after coining the term &ldquo;blowathon&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a public place &ndash;  thinking about what humorless prudes Kurt and Constance were, while the idea slowly soaked through my skull that the real problem was with me, not them.

    <div class="body">
        When it &ndash; the idea &ndash; finally touched my brain it made all of my spit dry up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on Kelso Street, which was this street filled with little shops and food places like the Main Street of a Christmas village.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the middle of winter and I had on these stupid leather mittens.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Fuck these!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said pretty loud and threw the mittens in this wire trash bin conveniently only a couple feet away from me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right then I figured I&rsquo;d rather let my hands freeze than see myself in public for one more second with leather mittens on my hands.

        A red-haired guy in one of those padded windbreakers heard me and laughed and kept walking past.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a shocked or suprised laugh or a laugh that asked a question.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was like he knew why I hated those fucking mittens.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was like he could see I was a preposterous character.&nbsp;&nbsp; A buffoon.

        Back in those days I was renting a big house off-campus with two guys and three girls.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all thought we were bohemians.&nbsp;&nbsp; But right when I ripped off my leather mittens I had this epiphany where I knew we were only pretending and we sucked at it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were nothing but big posers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We whimpered like six year-olds if our parents&rsquo; checks got delivered a day late.&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t write poetry for shit but we thought getting hangovers gave us some sort of kinship with Dylan Thomas.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put a big poster of Che Guevara over the bookcase in the living room for a whole semester before any of us knew who he was.

    <div class="body">
        And we went out in public wearing stupid fucking leather mittens!

        I sat down on a green bench on the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was twilight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights were coming on.&nbsp;&nbsp; People were walking past.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just thought about the scene in Pizza Meatsa with Kurt and Constance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought about it over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp; I obviously could not let anyone else have tail without resenting them for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked back over my life, the part of it with hardons in it at least, and realized that this was a distinct pattern and it was getting worse.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never actually blurted out my thoughts like that before, the way I did that night.&nbsp;&nbsp; It still didn&rsquo;t get Kurt off the hook for thinking he was now some sort of cuntsman or Constance for inflating his ego or both of them for acting all indignant and put-upon, but ...

        The Kurt and Constance episode was a wakeup call!

        So I called up my mom who said I should talk to a shrink and that&rsquo;s how I ended up with Fritz Koch.&nbsp;&nbsp; It helped, talking about it and figuring stuff out about it and being able to laugh about it, but I never really did all the way get rid of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile I found out a butt-load of other crap that was wrong with me that felt good to talk about.

        So remember when I said Christine the hot blonde forty year-old from that night at Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle called up Corrinne Junior to tell her that Parp was dislocating her jaw with his cock?&nbsp;&nbsp; I resented Parp for getting to fuck a hot blonde.&nbsp;&nbsp; And what made it even worse was I was being loyal to my wife at that point in time and at that point in time I think it was going on a year since I got a blowjob from her that could be described as verve-having.&nbsp;&nbsp; And several months since I&rsquo;d had any mouthular contact at all with the wife.
