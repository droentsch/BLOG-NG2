        My Wife Works for Hed
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That day in March &ndash; the day right after St.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ndash; when I met 
        Parp and he told me about <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>, I got back to
        my apartment around five-thirty.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was my day off from work tending bar
        so I got to come home at a regular time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner time, or as close to a
        regular dinner time as we ever get in my house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Somebody wash me!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shouted when I walked through the door of my
        apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hanging with the human turd!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I wanted to be solicited and consoled by the wife, who I couldn&rsquo;t see at
        first but who I knew was lurking someplace.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There&rsquo;s this really short
        hallway in my apartment so standing at the front door I could only see
        about a third of the living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The place smelled like bleach.&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, it didn&rsquo;t smell like
        food.&nbsp;&nbsp; So right away I knew we&rsquo;d be ordering in that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Are you talking about Tony?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Astute for five years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; He popped his head up from behind
        the arm of the sofa he was lying on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yup!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you remember our plan, don&rsquo;t you, Sammy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not our plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s our <em>policy</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He grinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a learner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s our policy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Never tell Tony he&rsquo;s the human turd?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ding ding ding ding ding ding!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He did one of those squeals he does like when I&rsquo;m tickling him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mommy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;She&rsquo;s heeeerrrrrre ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he grinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right ... <em>there!</em>
        &rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He pointed to a part of the living room I couldn&rsquo;t see yet and looked in
        my eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like he never heard of not trusting people.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        My boys and I are a team.&nbsp;&nbsp; I call us the Man Squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s Parp complaining about now?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Junior asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rounded the
        corner to catch her sitting at the computer on the desk in front of the
        exposed brick in the cul-de-sac of our livng room.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was still wearing
        her black suit from the day job.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        All of Junior&rsquo;s day-job suits feature nice cleavage exposure, and Junior
        definitely has the tits for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; You may as well get all the advantage
        you can in the dog-sniff-dog world of Manhattan day jobs, and hey, we all
        know that everything else being equal no man will want to make an enemy
        of a woman with suckable knobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Parp&rsquo;s in the basement mixin&rsquo; up the medicine,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I bent over and kissed her cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh look, she&rsquo;s writing an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Who you writing to?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hed,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I got in a discussion with him about the spelling of
        &lsquo;burqa&rsquo; and I have to send him a link.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I went over to get something comestible from the fridge to hold me until
        we ordered in whatever we were going to order in.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy crap,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &ldquo;Will you let it go?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I <em>know</em>
        ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; she whimpered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I found a bag of walnuts near the back of the fridge and fished it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior had come to New York twenty years earlier to be an actress.&nbsp;&nbsp; But
        last March, when we were having this conversation, she was managing the
        wait staff in the restaurant at the Museum of the Humanities on
        Fifty-Fifth Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Her boss at MoHum was a guy named Ed Borogan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed had a mushy, round body
        with a skull so massive that it still managed to look disproportionately
        huge on him, so all of his employees called him &ldquo;Hed.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked like a
        bobblehead of Karl Marx with glasses and an unwashed beard.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll just take a sec but if I don&rsquo;t do it I&rsquo;ll be thinking about Hed&rsquo;s
        smug smirk all night,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Junior said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hed wants to drill Mommy deep,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam volunteered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior and I froze and then turned to him in unison.&nbsp;&nbsp; No shit, it was like
        we were synchronized swimmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sammy giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Junior looked at me, crestfallen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sad, defeated
        look on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh God I said it on the phone ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; she moaned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I just stared at her.&nbsp;&nbsp; So.&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;d said something naughty in front of the
        boy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe in front of both boys.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was exactly the sort of bad behavior
        she was constantly giving me shit for.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just stared at her without
        smiling and ate walnuts from the bag and let her think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I went into the bedroom and closed the door for that conversation,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; she
        said, like she was throwing herself on the mercy of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But ...
        it&rsquo;s a small apartment.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I get it,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Extenuating circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She looked at me and grinned this big grin and batted her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        God, if only she&rsquo;d had someone else&rsquo;s cunt I could have so fucked her
        right then.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I think it just means we need to have a new policy,
        right Sammy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Our new policy is we never <em>ever</em>
        say that &lsquo;drilling&rsquo; thing in
        front of Mr. Borogan, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he said and giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp; What a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I turned to the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sammy&rsquo;s never going to meet Hed anyway,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She sort of smiled, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure, because she wasn&rsquo;t even
        looking at me any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was looking at the damn computer screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Me chomping walnuts behind the counter that separated the kitchen area
        from the living room area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sammy lying on the sofa giggling and swishing
        his plastic light saber.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wife polishing off an email.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; It was quite
        a family portrait, except that Harry wasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the wife&rsquo;s
        rack in profile for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>No wonder Hed wants to fuck her</em>, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time there 
        was a part of me that kind of suspected he <em>was</em>
        fucking her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
        mean, why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, she <em>is</em>
        a ball-sucking adulteress (as I 
        now know for sure).&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the only reason I was pretty sure she <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em>
        fucking Hed was that he was a greasy fat-boy who looked
        like he had on a t-shirt with a marinara stain even when he was wearing a
        business suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        On our refrigerator door, tacked on with magnets in the shape of little
        red devils, we have this list: &ldquo;Top Ten Cholesterol-Fighting Foods.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
        might have a list like that on your refrigerator door.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Top Ten
        Belly-Flattening Foods&rdquo; or &ldquo;Top Ten Things To Do This Week.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        On Hed&rsquo;s refrigerator door I&rsquo;m pretty sure he has: &ldquo;Top Ten Excuses For
        Farting In a Public Place.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So yeah I was pretty sure Junior wasn&rsquo;t fucking Hed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Which kind of begged the question: <em>Where and how is Junior getting
            her cunt filled?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I didn&rsquo;t know what the wife&rsquo;s theory was about my not wanting to fill her
        cunt myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guessed she had some prefab explanation from a magazine or
        a blog.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was also pretty sure she knew more about my gothic-chasm
        aversion than she let on.&nbsp;&nbsp; She never said a damn thing about it directly,
        but she had ... intuitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I tipped her off unconsciously.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And she must have also known that I was ready to ball anyone who showed 
        the right kind of interest in me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, maybe she thought I&rsquo;d changed,  
        but for crying out loud I was <em>with</em>
        someone the night I met
        Junior and ended up fucking her in the bathroom stall at Freddy&rsquo;s in
        Brooklyn.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the person I was with was my fiancee, Janey, who had
        superior snatch muscles but a mouth like an egg-beater.&nbsp;&nbsp; So Junior knew
        there were definite limits on my regard for the virtue of fidelity.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
        knew me better than to believe me when I swore to God I&rsquo;d changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; See
        hon, I have kids now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could never risk all of you
        &ndash; all of this &ndash; for a fuck in a bathroom stall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What makes you think she reads you like that?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica asked me once.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;She just broke out crying yesterday and said, &lsquo;Paul, I had this very
        vivid dream last night and in it you were fucking that slut Lucille!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Lucille was this co-worker of mine who spent forty-five minutes a day
        just working out her ass muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hm,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you never know.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could be giving off a
        vibe.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>A vibe</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; That will be one hundred and fifty dollars please, or
        whatever the insurance company is paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Harry?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked the wife after she clicked &ldquo;send&rdquo; and came back
        to the world of solids.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s over at Fox&rsquo;s tonight,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had a beddums planned
        for three weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;A beddums?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Some character on one of these programs has sleepovers with gorillas and
        pixies &ndash; all other little boys and girls of course &ndash; and they call them
        &lsquo;beddums.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sounds vaguely effeminate,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The wife stood up and stretched and said: &ldquo;Only vaguely?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; And she gave
        me this big grin that I didn&rsquo;t really understand but which in retrospect
        I can see was definitely of the shit-eating variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she <em>was</em>
        fucking Hed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sam laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mommy&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </div>
</div>
