        Lord of All Tail
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I have this issue with Parp, but he isn&rsquo;t the reason I got into therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to remind myself of that sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica says I use Parp to avoid the main problem, which is ... 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;My major problem &ndash; the problem I talk about most with Jessica when she can make me get past my own bullshit and the problem I started out with twenty-five years ago in college in Upstate New York &ndash; is simple yet profound: 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I need to be lord of all tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;My condition dictates that my friends think of me as the cunt lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay if my friends have the attentions of females, but only if they know I could have said attentions if I wanted them. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It also helps if their girlfriends are dumpy. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        You may think this is a trivial problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;It really isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a big damn deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in my youth the proposition was fused into my consciousness that if I am not the group cunt lord then I am no one.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of my other drives and ambitions, it turns out, are in service of this need to have &ndash; as Fritz Koch, my original college therapist said &ndash; &ldquo;<em>le droit de seigneur. </em>&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Literally that means the right of the lord to ball le wife of any tenant on his land.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no land and no tenants so I make do with my friends. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Don&rsquo;t ask me how I got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guys, you know, some guys have to be the funniest guy in the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Group clown.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guys have to be group jock.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they aren&rsquo;t they become alienated from themselves, strangers in their own lives, desperate. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That&rsquo;s the way it is with me and needing to be lord of all tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a guy I know gets tail that I couldn&rsquo;t have first ... well, he <em>can&rsquo;t</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s not allowed. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Don&rsquo;t judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m in therapy. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Fritz &ndash; Dr. Koch &ndash; never judged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out loud.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew what he was writing on his pad though?&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first showed up in his office and told him my problem, a fraction of me thought he might say: 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But Paul, we <em>all</em>
        need to be lord of all tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a man thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell you what, buy me a drink and I won&rsquo;t charge you for the visit.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It didn&rsquo;t seem so far-fetched at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;All men need to be lord of all tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have bought it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would have felt a special, unspoken camaraderie with my brother lords.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe I would have killed them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But Fritz never let me think that it was a common problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was almost grave about my condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was pretty grave when I suggested &ndash; jokingly --  that a real therapist would lie to me about all men needing to be lords of all tail.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Do you think that describes the reality you live in?&rdquo; asked Fritz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think people lie to you like that, to make your life easier for you?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Nahhh,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try the opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do people go out of their way to make you feel uncomfortable?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Funny he should ask. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this kid in my class.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And what does Tony do that makes you feel bad about yourself?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember what I was going to say. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I would tell you if I could remember what exactly made me think of Parp right then.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I remember now is that he was a mean little prick in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hanger-on.&nbsp;&nbsp;George Vider&rsquo;s toady.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Parp twists the knife,&rdquo; one of the smarter chicks in play analysis class said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Vider puts the knife in and Parp twists it.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But I nearly digress.&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s important is that I figured out, with the help of Fritz, that I could deal with my need to be lord of all tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a huge relief, because it was really starting to hang me up with my man friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days before meeting Fritz it almost caused me to get punched in the face. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, in those days I was regularly banging a couple girls &ndash; not at the same time, but serially, like a regular guy who loves the one he&rsquo;s with &ndash; and they had some great tails on them. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Great</em>
        tails. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then this one day I was just off campus at a place called Pizza Meatsa with Kurt Libby, the nicest guy you&rsquo;d ever want to meet, a little tubby blonde-haired guy who in spite of being a chunky little putz got on the wrestling team in his high school in Ann Arbor and won a letter for it. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Who knew you could letter in wrestling? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But he was also pretty shy back then, and chicks kind of scared him, so unless a babe made the first move &ndash; and the second move &ndash; he was going to be beating off until graduation. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Which by the way makes him the ideal friend if you&rsquo;re somebody who needs to be lord of all tail. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But just a few days before that &ndash; a few days before we met up at Pizza Meatsa &ndash; some babe grabbed him, told him something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to blow you now you pasty fuck,&rdquo; and the next thing you know he&rsquo;s in a closet at a party while somebody on her knees is unbuckling his pants in the dark. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now, Pizza Meatsa was this cavernous place with rows of heavy, wooden, varnished tables in wide booths.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisles of booths.&nbsp;&nbsp;And a jukebox.&nbsp;&nbsp;Disco was big back then.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kurt Libby was sitting across from me in the booth at Pizza Meatsa I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was the BeeGees playing. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Kurt told me about the blowjob &ndash; the fantastic blowjob, this slow, slurping, blowjob-from-heaven &ndash; that he got from this new love of his life, and his voice and his face are all, &ldquo;Shit really happens, Paul!&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now here&rsquo;s the part that means I have to be in therapy. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, when Kurt told me he&rsquo;d gotten swooped down on by a chick who just had to have his cock, and that he spent the weekend with her regrowing poundable bone, I didn&rsquo;t feel good for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I was getting laid by babes with fantastic tails.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no reason to feel ... <em>slighted</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;There was available ass at this party and Kurt Libby caught it because I couldn&rsquo;t be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck!&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And what really bugged me is that I got no sense from him that he knew he&rsquo;d only scored because I wasn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp;&nbsp;That tail is my turf. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I&rsquo;m thinking, what is he, stupid?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m funny, hip Paul!&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s butterball Kurt Libby! 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I resented the little shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he mean springing this on me while I was eating French fries with ketchup at Pizza Meatsa and the BeeGees were playing on the jukebox?&nbsp;&nbsp;I had him pegged as a safe conversant.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I wanted to hear someone rage on and on about the sweet piece of tail he scored I&rsquo;d be hanging with ... well, I wouldn&rsquo;t be hanging with Kurt Libby. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He ambushed me! 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He looked at me funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Something wrong, Paul?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s like, is it okay if somebody likes me?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp;How presumptuous is that? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course you should get a piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should get more than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the merrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;When my friends score, it is a joy unsurpassed.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m just a little nervous &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m with her now and I&rsquo;m kind of funny about how you guys are going to react.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;De nada,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re still seeing this girl?&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not onto the next conquest?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I laughed really hard right there.&nbsp;&nbsp;But still no indication that he knew how funny it was to imagine him moving on to another &ldquo;conquest.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming here now to meet me.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can meet her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name is Constance.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Connie?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Constance.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I get to meet this twat that thinks Kurt is a score.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh look, here she comes. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I could see her shadow hovering over the varnished table-top while Kurt Libby the tubby ex-letterman turned and said, &ldquo;Hey Constance,&rdquo; with this stupid, are-you-my-new-mommy look on his face. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hey Paul this is Constance.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I could feel myself not looking up at the caster of the shadow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a palpable non-movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see a pink scarf with gold bangles in it getting thrown into the booth beside Kurt, and hands moving to take off a ... coat? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then I looked.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a sweater with tits in it and had red hair in a bun, but not too tight, so some strands of hair flaked off the nape of her neck in that way that you just know they know makes you want to fuck them, but because it isn&rsquo;t tits or ass or cunt they can say, &ldquo;What ... what are you talking about?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But they know. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hi Paul,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at me for a split second, then turned right back to fat Kurt and dragged her sweater, tits, and nape over next to him and kissed him like I wasn&rsquo;t even there. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That pissed me off.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t see that I was alone?&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t think that might mean I was available?&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I&rsquo;m not saying she had to jump me, but hey: <em>eyes on the big boy. </em>
        It was like she was going out of her way to make me feel undesirable, nobody, a stranger in my own life, desperate. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Or maybe she just thinks I&rsquo;m out of her league.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s small-time and she&rsquo;s trying to be realistic about what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Admirable, in a way. </em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I was just getting comfortable thinking she must know I&rsquo;m out of her league when for some reason I opened my mouth and this came out:  &ldquo;I hear you just gave this tubby fuck his first blowjob ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually have a very high giggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Or wait, I guess it was more of a weekend blowathon.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I almost made a remark about how the basketball team must not have been in town, but something stopped me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to think it was what people call &ldquo;better judgment.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Better late than never, but not much better. 
    </div>
</div>
