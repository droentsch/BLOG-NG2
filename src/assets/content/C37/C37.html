	<div class="chapterSubhead">The Big Crap Enigma</div>
	<div class='body'>It&rsquo;s been a long while since I thought
		about that evening with big-crap Cynthia but last night when I banged
		out her story the old curiosity got ahold of me again.</div>
	<div class='body'>Back then when it happened I only talked about
		it with Parp and Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica thought I was overreacting so I
		wrote the episode off to me being stupid and maybe missing out on
		a series of great blow-jobs and anal sex just because I didn&rsquo;t
		understand some Bronx colloquialism about crap and farms.</div>
	<div class='body'>But there&rsquo;s stuff about the whole
		adventure that I never could make sense of and still can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		fell asleep last night thinking about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I dreamed anything I
		forgot.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then today I had to go down to the Commodore
		Hotel for a meeting with management on when union members like me were
		coming back to work at the Tavern.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t mention I&rsquo;m going
		back to work in a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Less time to crank out the book but I also
		get a paycheck again which is pretty handy when it comes time to feed
		the boys.</div>
	<div class='body'>And while I was down there in one of the
		auditoriums at the Commodore listening to some guy in a suede jacket
		and sneakers talk about the bad economy and how the tea party
		sabotaged Obama and how it&rsquo;s great to still have job, blah,
		blah, blah, my mind wandered back to Cynthia.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting next to
		Jonno, the main chef at the tavern, a big black guy from Puerto Rico
		who&rsquo;s had rude and raucous adventures all over the world like he
		was an ass-pounding Forrest Gump.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought he might be able to help
		me figure out the big-crap enigma.</div>
	<div class='body'>So after the speeches which I guess were
		supposed to indoctrinate us to the new world of labor relations down
		at the Irish Tavern me and Jonno adjourned to the hotel bar but when
		we got up on the stools the absence of hookers reminded us it was too
		early for drinks so we got some sodas from one of the shops in the
		concourse and sat down in the corner of the lobby off the Fiftieth
		Street entrance.</div>
	<div class='body'>A quiet corner in a quiet lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture with
		dark burgundy upholstery.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked out of place in sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like it
		was there for the people who had jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;People who wouldn&rsquo;t be
		around until it was dark.</div>
	<div class='body'>Jonno sat in a chair and put his leg over one
		of the arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat on the sofa at an angle to him and resisted the
		urge to put my feet up on the coffee table in front of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; An
		urge almost as bad as the urge to light up a cig.</div>
	<div class='body'>We talked shit for a few minutes then I
		mentioned I was wondering if he could help me figure something out
		that had been bugging me for awhile and he said okay and I told him
		the story about that evening with Cynthia.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		When I was done he just looked at me for a few seconds and then he
		grinned and said: &ldquo;Why you asking <em>me</em>, man?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>He smiled like it was a friendly joke I was
		having with him.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about it in
		awhile but last night I had a dream about it,&rdquo; I lied.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		didn&rsquo;t want to tell him about the book I&rsquo;m writing to get
		revenge on my cock-sucking wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s on my mind, ya
		know?&nbsp;&nbsp;I never really did get it figured out back then.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>He looked at me again then laughed like my
		uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp;No kidding, if Jonno was the only fat guy you&rsquo;d ever met
		you&rsquo;d think the clich&eacute; about all fat guys being jolly was
		really true.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Scat,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know
		it&rsquo;s scat, man!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I knew you were going to say that, but I
		don&rsquo;t think it makes any sense.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guys love the big turds
		man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies shitting on them, ladies shitting in front of them
		...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, I know, I&rsquo;ve been out to the
		Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what would make her just assume I&rsquo;m one of those
		guys?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say nothing to
		her?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really <em>really</em> not into scat.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what did you <em>say</em> to her?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Swear to God I didn&rsquo;t say a thing.
		I&rsquo;ve been over it and over it in my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing we
		talked about was that my wife doesn&rsquo;t like head that much but I
		really love giving it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Tig-ha!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he snort-laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well lemme think about
		it lemme think about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You sure you told me <em>everything</em> you
		said to her?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Every damn thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay, lemme think.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		He folded his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he
		looked around like he wanted to make extra, <em>extra</em> sure we
		wouldn&rsquo;t be overheard and said: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say to
		her nothing like, &lsquo;My wife got this big butt I wanna lick but
		she&rsquo;s too uptight&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I still say scat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know
		what you did?&nbsp;&nbsp;But she thought you wanted a load, amigo.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hey hey.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the corner came
		Kurt Libby, who I thought I saw there earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have mentioned in
		chapter six or eight or something that he tends bar at the Commodore.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hey Kurt,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Libby,&rdquo; Jonno said.
		&ldquo;What&rsquo;s life like in Harlem?&nbsp;&nbsp;Still got the wife and three
		cats?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Livin&rsquo; the dream, boys,&rdquo;
		Kurt said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he giggled like an ass and fumbled out a cigarette.
		&ldquo;You guys mind taking this out to the sidewalk so I can light
		up?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I was all set to say &ldquo;yeah sure&rdquo;
		because I was aching to light up myself but Jonno beat me.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;As a matter of fact I do mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
		just gettin&rsquo; comfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Kurt said like it was no
		problem, no problem at all to forget about his nicotine fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the
		cigarette back in the pack and grinned at Jonno while Jonno laughed
		like he&rsquo;d just made the fat kid do ten more push-ups.</div>
	<div class='body'>Kurt sat down on the coffee table in front of
		us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really not supposed to do that but nobody who&rsquo;d squeal was
		watching.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to help Paul figure
		something out,&rdquo; Jonno said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah?&nbsp;&nbsp;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>So I told Libby the story.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he said when I was done.
		&ldquo;So what like makes you think she didn&rsquo;t just have to
		shit?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;The bathroom was right there and she
		didn&rsquo;t move for it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re only there for like
		thirty seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she was holding it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jonno laughed like a
		maniac, &ldquo;she was saving it to dump on his chest!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Huh-huh, huh-huh,&rdquo; Libby laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So Paul
		you&rsquo;re saying this freak is in the <em>Little Round Jewish
			Hat</em> video?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re re-shooting that out in
		L.A.&nbsp;&nbsp;now right?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was getting a little
		irritated.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So how come you&rsquo;re not out there
		re-shooting it with them?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>Fuckhole.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just stared at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, I wanted a
		smoke.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Which one was she?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; asked Jonno.
		&ldquo;I seen that video a few times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m gonna have to see
		it again.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;She was the...you remember when
		they&rsquo;re doing that big dance number down the so-called
		&lsquo;Soho Strip&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s this fat guy at the
		piano?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Vider,&rdquo; said Libby.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; asked Jonno.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;George Vider,&rdquo; Libby said.
		&ldquo;The comic.&nbsp;&nbsp;You never heard of him?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Me and Paul went to school with him.
		He&rsquo;s the fat guy in the video playing the piano.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And
		there&rsquo;s this pole on the piano and these strippers in yarmulkes
		and hot pants are dancing around on it?&nbsp;&nbsp;She was one of those
		chicks.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What did you do, close down that whole
		street?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jonno asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nah, green screen, right Paul?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Kurt asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, if he and Parp hadn&rsquo;t parted ways he might
		have been there last March instead of me.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh, I get it,&rdquo; Jonno said.
		&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you were saying about you were shooting in
		the restaurant and she followed you out.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it, what does
		&lsquo;like on a farm&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libby asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did she
		mean like a farm animal?&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a cow?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Maybe she meant like a campesino, you
		know?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jonno said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like a peasant.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Peasants crap big?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Jonno said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
		guess out on the farm they get more fiber, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Seems like a stretch,&rdquo; I said.
		&ldquo;I think she meant like a cow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Float like a butterfly, crap like a
		bee,&rdquo; Libby said.</div>
	<div class='body'>I laughed but I really didn&rsquo;t get it.</div>
	<div class='body'>Jonno shrugged.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think he got it
		either.&nbsp;&nbsp;So Libby changed the subject pretty fast.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hey-hey Jonno, word around the town is
		you&rsquo;re back banging Fat Fern, huh-huh-huh.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;You mean <em>Fern</em>,&rdquo; Jonno said with this big grin.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah-yeah, Fern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh-huh.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m seeing her again.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		He looked at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Man, she is pissed at you!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, ha,
		ha...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he rolled with the laugh but he never broke eye
		contact.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Still?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Holy shit, yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m supposed to
		kick your ass if I ever see you!&nbsp;&nbsp;I have strict fucking instructions,
		so I guess today we never met!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, ha, ha...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>Now Libby was giggling, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He ruined
		it for eight guys,&rdquo; he said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Eight?!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jonno laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All
		right, Fern!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I gotta go, guys,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Libby said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fern
		works in this hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh-huh-huh.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she sees you she&rsquo;ll chase
		you down and sit on your head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh-huh-huh.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I looked at him for a second before Jonno
		laughed and said, &ldquo;You crack me up, Libby.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I split while the two of them were talking
		about fat Fern and Kurt&rsquo;s wife Kandace who is now enrolled in a
		seminary of all places.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kandace Libby: blonde
		hair, round ass, and her cunt belongs to Jesus.</div>
	<div class='body'>But here&rsquo;s the really fucked-up part.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
		soon as I step out of the elevator in my apartment building the cell
		rings and it&rsquo;s Libby.&nbsp;&nbsp;And what does Libby want?&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know
		if I&rsquo;ve still got Cynthia&rsquo;s phone number.</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No can do, Kurt.
		She&rsquo;s got a boyfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh-huh...what?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really not going to give me
		her number?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember Parp asking you
		for some chick&rsquo;s number three Christmases ago?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
		retard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember what you said to him?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>Long pause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh
		yeahhhhhhhhh...huh-huh-huh.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was different, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp was
		being an asshole stalker.&nbsp;&nbsp;So...I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I have her number?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re just going to call her
		up.&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yuh.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d give it to you if I had
		it Kurtz.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>Had to keep my voice low.&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t go
		into the apt because I didn&rsquo;t want to have to explain this end
		of the conversation to the boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrow walls painted the same
		yellow as the naked lightbulbs and the smell of catbox coming from
		three directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted off the phone and in the apartment.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there like a contact sheet
		or something?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might have
		that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Google doc.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there&rsquo;s more than one Cynthia
		you&rsquo;re shit out of luck if you know what I mean.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re thinking I&rsquo;m
		kind of a, you know, freak,&rdquo; he said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Because you like getting crapped on?&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		guess there&rsquo;s worse kinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the one with the
		twenty-foot-tall women who like to jam little men up their
		butts.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, uh, I didn&rsquo;t say I
		liked getting crapped on, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just like...Okay, I just like seeing
		a honey with a nice tush rap one out now and then.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>There was a long pause.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just beginning to
		think we were disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge,
		man.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wife is in the seminary.
		I&rsquo;m just glad I could do you this solid.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah?&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh-huh-huh.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
