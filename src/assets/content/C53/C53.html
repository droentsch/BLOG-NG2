    The Ballsy Stratagem
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    A couple days later me and Parp were standing in front of the Starbucks at 93rd and Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the night off from the
    bar and Junior was out at NorthScouts watching Harry in some crafts exhibition.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“She was where?&nbsp;&nbsp;Northscouts?&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is Northscouts?” you might be asking if you’re reading this in Alabama or Yemen.
  </div>
  <div class="body">See, NorthScouts is this organization like the Boy Scouts only for kids of all sexes but only if they live in the Northeast.
    And the kids who belong to Northscouts?&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to do stuff to earn badges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually this is out-doorsy stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuff
    that modern kids don’t do enough of what with television and the Internet keeping them indoors and on their asses most
    of the time.
  </div>
  <div class="body">Like for instance: if they chop a tree in half?&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s a badge for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there’s no badge for posting shit to Twitter.
  </div>
  <div class="body">The badge Harry was trying for tonight was this one where you have to take some blueprint they give you at one of their
    weekly meetings and build a thing from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So all last week Harry was home after school with glue and tiny nails and
    I bought him this little saw for cutting balsa wood.
  </div>
  <div class="body">And when the week was up?&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom.&nbsp;&nbsp;New-made thing.
  </div>
  <div class="body">It looked like a windmill with a little axe attached that I guess would chop things when the wind blew.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“So what’s the axe supposed to chop, Harry?” I asked.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“I dunno,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Squirrels?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if a squirrel is bad then when he dies he gets sent to this windmill to get his head
    cut off.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Or maybe it’s for wood,” Junior called over.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe it’s to help the farmers chop up their kindling.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Okay,” Harry said.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was the kind of “okay” you say to your Mom because she’s being your Mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, humane and
    practical, which is no fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;So his eyes were still dancing with the thought of bad little squirrels getting their final
    comeuppance.
  </div>
  <div class="body">He seemed really pleased with the little wind-chopper and we all told him what a great job he did including Sammy who wanted
    to take it outside to see it chopping in the breeze.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Let’s leave it inside for now,” I said.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Maybe Harry will let you take it out later, after he’s had a chance to show it at NorthScouts,” Junior said.
  </div>
  <div class="body">So me and Junior were both supposed to be with Harry that night in this high school auditorium and maybe taking pictures
    while people applauded and shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I begged off at the last minute.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Work emergency,” I said to Junior on the phone.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“They really can’t get anyone else tonight, Paul?”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“That’s the emergency!&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s out with the chicken Chinese flu or whatever it is.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">She hung up on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should have stung more, but I was kind of getting used to it.
  </div>
  <div class="body">And I really needed the night all the way off, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, I’d make it up to Harry later by surprising him with
    a baseball mitt or something.
  </div>
  <div class="body">So that night I had about three hours to myself that I could spend either enjoying Internet porn in the traditional manly
    fashion or talking to Parp about how to whip Admiral Ballsy into shape for the follow-up date from Cammy that I was hoping
    to score.
  </div>
  <div class="body">I chose talking to Parp.
  </div>
  <div class="body">Parp showed up a split-second after I did but I needed a smoke so we talked small on the sidewalk while I finished a cigarette.
    Then we went in and got coffee.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“So that whole adventure at the Roundabout took what, forty-five minutes?” he asked after I told him about the date.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
    were sitting at a table in a kind of quiet corner in the back.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Oh, I think it was about an hour and a half if you count the lull between the scenes.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“There was an intermission?”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“I’m not shitting you.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had it all planned out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two scenes and what the British call an ‘interval’.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“So… an hour an a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn’t sound terrible.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Yeah, well, the cock-pleasing part of the evening was over in about ten minutes,” I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;“The rest of the time we spent
    in the aforementioned entr’acte or else with me licking her.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“So your cock was in the game for ten minutes?”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to go longer, but, you know, Admiral Ballsy got caught looking the other way.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“What, you mean you couldn’t get it up?”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“No, no, see, I got it up fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, yeah, there were some opening night jitters but they went away after I had a blast
    of bourbon.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Okay…”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“But when she was pretending to be the little boy that bites plank?&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me this incredible blowjob.&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of blowjob
    that makes you think about divorcing your wife and moving into some little hut with a grass roof on the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;And after
    that, Admiral Ballsy was stunned, tapped, spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;So he kind of benched himself for the rest of the game.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“And after that she just rode your face for an hour?”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“It felt like at least three days but I guess it was about ten minutes cunt, ten minutes asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the times don’t
    exactly add up, but that’s my best sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t usually check the clock when I’m throwing the bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in this case
    the tongue.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">He just drank his coffee.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“So, hey lookit,” I said, “the reason I asked you here to tell you this?&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn’t just for the camaraderie.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">He looked at me with this little grin-flicker.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pretended not to notice.
  </div>
  <div class="body">“I was thinking you might have some ideas on how I could, you know, fix that.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know how like usually I’m not interested
    in hearing about the gym and the diet and the vitamin pills?&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s just say I’m willing to give all of that a shot if
    it means Admiral Ballsy can get back up to ramming speed.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Wow,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cameron must really make an impression with her pants off.”
  </div>
  <div class="body">“Um…”
  </div>
  <div class="body">That “um”?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a sad “um” my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t realize it until it came out of my mouth, but when I heard it I knew
    it was the “um” of the unloved and rootless.
