    <div class="body"> So the next day I had a session with Jessica. &nbsp;And &nbsp;I guess I would say it was a godsend if I believed in God
        which&hellip; okay. &nbsp;I sometimes think I might. &nbsp;Kind of. &nbsp;I mean I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s particularly
        interested in guys like me but what do I know? &nbsp; </div>
    <div class="body"> And hey. &nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m some sort of red-state Jesus Freak. &nbsp;For the record? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s
        just nutty. &nbsp;It takes a lot of balls to say you know that God exists and what he wants and who he likes. &nbsp;But
        being an atheist? &nbsp;Saying you&rsquo;ve seen enough of the universe to know there&rsquo;s no God in it? &nbsp;That
        takes some stones too. </div>
    <div class="body"> Parp is an atheist. &nbsp;The presumptuous shit. </div>
    <div class="body"> See, that&rsquo;s one of the main differences between me and Parp. &nbsp;If you told Parp you believed in God and maybe
        one or two prophets and that these prophets could turn loaves into fishes and whatnot? &nbsp;And that if you laughed
        at one who happened to be bald a she-bear would rush out and eat your kids? &nbsp;He&rsquo;d laugh at you and make
        jokes about your frontal lobe. &nbsp;Me? &nbsp;I&rsquo;d just think you might know something I don&rsquo;t. </div>
    <div class="body"> It&rsquo;s called knowing your limitations. &nbsp;Or maybe knowing you&rsquo;re human. &nbsp;Or maybe just humility.
    </div>
    <div class="body"> Am I right? </div>
    <div class="body"> So. &nbsp;My session with Jessica. &nbsp;I was sitting in the chair across from her stealing man-stares at this plaid
        shirt she was wearing and that was open a few buttons down from the neck like she was hoping I&rsquo;d look. &nbsp;I
        could see that under the shirt she was wearing this tight black strappy thing that I at first thought was her bra
        that she wanted me to see and then I thought hey maybe it&rsquo;s a leotard and she has yoga class right after our
        session. &nbsp;But as I kept stealing glimpses of it I began to think it might be made out of rubber. </div>
    <div class="body"> I definitely started thinking of the possibilities. &nbsp;In parallel. &nbsp;I was having three different fantasies at
        once all triggered by the sight of rubber against my therapist&rsquo;s tits when she looked up at me from the pad
        she&rsquo;d been writing in. &nbsp;I made sure I had this chilled-out or laid-back or I-don&rsquo;t-care look on
        my face. &nbsp;Like, yeah. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m staring in your direction but I&rsquo;m pretty much just waiting for you
        to finish up writing whatever you&rsquo;re writing so we can get down to business. </div>
    <div class="body"> I told her all about the Inaugural Ball and about how Parp helped me with the Roundabout Inn gold card and how he was
        going to help me out with the diet and the exercise and my general physical improvement but that the thought of selling
        my soul to him just so I could maybe have a hardon when I boned Cammy next time was making me more than a little
        depressed.
    </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it seems, well, a little unusual, based on what you&rsquo;ve said in the past,
        that Tony would go out of his way to help you like that. &nbsp;Is there something about this whole... I mean, are
        you sure there&rsquo;s no quid pro quo in this for him?&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> Fucked if I knew. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought he was just helping a guy out
        because of... you know what he said. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all a big adventure with him. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about the
        oppressed having a rebeliion and overthrowing the rich and excercising their cocks. &nbsp;Like those kids in
        <em>Les Miserables</em> &nbsp;on the barracades fighting the bourgeoisie. &nbsp;Which in this case happens to be anybody
        who wants me to stay with Junior.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just kind of an aesthetic interest? &nbsp;He&rsquo;s
        an anti-marriage romanticist?&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> It was like she was trying to sound over-the-top ironic, you know? &nbsp;The way parents and therapists and wives do
        sometimes when they&rsquo;re trying to make you think something through. &mdash; Like they have a criticism they
        think is as obvious as math and they want you to use your brain to figure it out for yourself. </div>
    <div class="body"> I hate it when people do that. </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s just this lonely guy who wants to believe that anyone living with a three-dimensional woman is
        some kind of hostage who needs liberating,&rdquo; I said. </div>
    <div class="body"> I definitely wanted her to see Parp as the basest element of human, well,
        <em>baseness</em> . &nbsp;But I didn&rsquo;t want her to start asking me again why I was his chum, or why I hung around
        him
        <em>pretending</em> &nbsp;to be his chum. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been trying to answer that question for years and it just
        goes nowhere. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like the hamster that jumps in the wheel thinking this time he might just make it
        to Jersey City. &nbsp;And after a day of running and running and running he realizes &mdash;
        <em>again</em> &nbsp;&mdash; that he hasn&rsquo;t moved an inch. </div>
    <div class="body"> Yeah. &nbsp;I had a hamster when I was eight. &nbsp;Lenny. &nbsp;And swear to God if Lenny could have slapped his forehead
        I&rsquo;d have heard it three rooms away every afternoon. </div>
    <div class="body"> Well, I&rsquo;m done being Lenny. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m done kidding myself that one more run in the wheel will have me and
        Parp all figured out. </div>
    <div class="body"> &nbsp; &ldquo;You know what I mean?&rdquo; I continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that he hates my wife and kids I
        don&rsquo;t think. &nbsp;I just think he dreams of the day when all men will be emancipated from their families so
        they join him in his faux-French drama with Jean Anouilh and Pauline R&eacute;age.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> I gigcackled. </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;But seriously,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in this for him?&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;I really think that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;It annoyed me that she thought her professionalism required
        her to pretend my jokes weren&rsquo;t witty. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making up excuses for him. &nbsp;On the one
        hand he&rsquo;s this incredible malcontent who thinks the whole world is doing everything wrong and that he, Tony
        Parp, knows how to make it all right. &nbsp;And on the other hand, he&rsquo;s always looking for ways to pervert
        anything normal. &nbsp;So when some hot piece of ass like Cammy comes along he sees his chance to roll it my way
        and destroy a relationship I&rsquo;ve taken years to build up. &mdash; A relationship with children in it. &nbsp;Children!&rdquo;
        </div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica gave me this look like&hellip; Okay. &nbsp;If she&rsquo;d been wearing glasses? &nbsp;She&rsquo;d be looking over
        the tops. &nbsp;You know what I mean? &nbsp;The
        <em>rims</em> . &nbsp;It was the look that said we both knew I was full of horseshit. </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I said that was one way of looking at it. &nbsp;I distinctly said &lsquo;on
        the one hand&rsquo;.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you gave me both hands.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;You said on the one hand he thinks he can improve everything, and on the other hand he&rsquo;s trying to pervert
        everything.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body"> I looked at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;So you want me counting hands now?&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, no, I just want to understand. &nbsp;So there&rsquo;s a third way of interpreting Tony? </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;There is
        <em>another</em> &nbsp;way.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> She just stared at me, pen on her pad, waiting for me to explain myself. </div>
    <div class="body"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of like I said before, he&rsquo;s maybe the loneliest guy in the world. &nbsp;And you know what
        would make him happy? &nbsp;Next to having somebody of his own? &nbsp;Somebody to wake up with and talk to and&hellip;
        you know. &nbsp;All that other good stuff? &nbsp;The only other thing that would make him happy is to see everybody
        else just as lonely as he is. &nbsp;Yeah. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body"> She kind of laughed and swear to God the laugh started out as a sneer she couldn&rsquo;t stifle for some reason. </div>
    <div class="body"> Now here&rsquo;s the part that made this session a godsend. &nbsp;First, she totally put my mind at ease about Parp and
        whether or not doing his little experimenty things meant I was selling my soul to him. &nbsp;She said a
        <em>lot</em> &nbsp;of people do the Parp stuff. &nbsp;Maybe they don&rsquo;t do the superfoods or the compression-fit
        t-shirts and they definitely don&rsquo;t wear the ridiculous round purple shades, but otherwise it was pretty normal
        stuff. &nbsp;I felt relieved. &nbsp;In fact, I felt so relieved I almost forgot she sneer-laughed at me just a few
        seconds before. </div>
    <div class="body"> There was this one thing she said that for some reason really calmed me down. &nbsp;She said even squares go to the gym.
        &nbsp;And they don&rsquo;t think twice about it! &nbsp;Guys in suits you see walking down the street? &nbsp;They&rsquo;re
        at the gym a lot of times except for the really broken down and skinny ones. </div>
    <div class="body"> Maybe you think I&rsquo;m a jackass for not knowing this already. &nbsp;Okay. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s say in your world squares
        going to the gym is common knowledge. &nbsp;Maybe you&rsquo;re even some square who meets up with your fellow squares
        at the gym and you have this ritual where you simultaneously take off your ties and pull on your sweats. &nbsp;Fantastic
        for you and your world. &nbsp;But in my world? &nbsp;Shit, the only guys I knew who went to the gym every day were
        underwear models. </div>
    <div class="body"> Like I said: knowing that the gym thing was completely ordinary made me feel a lot better. &nbsp;If Libby or Jonno gave
        me shit for gymming it up? &nbsp;I&rsquo;d just say: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey. &nbsp;Dude. &nbsp;Millions of people go to
        the gym. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m stacking dumbbells in my apartment. &nbsp;
        <em>That&rsquo;s</em> &nbsp;just
        <em>nutty</em> .&rdquo; </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Yeah, that&rsquo;ll shut them up</em> , I thought. </div>
    <div class="body"> And about the vitamins? &nbsp;Jessica kind of said the items I told her about probably couldn&rsquo;t hurt just as long
        as I didn&rsquo;t take this thing called mimby or himby and that was made from tree bark and that I guess is famous
        for giving guys hardons but only after giving some of them heart attacks. </div>
    <div class="body"> I was pretty sure none of the stuff on Parp&rsquo;s list had an &ldquo;imby&rdquo; sound in it but I could check again
        and oh yeah check to see if there was any tree bark mentioned on the labels. </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>So</em> , I thought. &nbsp;
        <em>New man it is . &nbsp; I wonder what I&rsquo;ll be like?</em>
    </div>
