	<div class="chapterSubhead">Junior's Anal Virtues</div>
	<div class='body'>For breakfast on the morning of the day of the
		Inaugural Ball &mdash; Saturday &mdash; Junior made me some fluffy
		waffles soaked in butter and maple syrup the way I like so when I bite
		down on each lovely morsel it&rsquo;s like eating oozy sugar-sponges.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>And she was cheerful. &nbsp;Out-of-the-blue,
		wait-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop cheerful. &nbsp;She was wearing dark
		blue jeans with a butt seam that curved into her gape and sneakers
		with lifts that molded her ass into the international symbol for
		&ldquo;insert penis here.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled aloud and she looked over and
		grinned.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; she asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Just thinkin&rsquo; about the
		international situation,&rdquo; I said slyly.</div>
	<div class='body'>She went back to rinsing like she
		couldn&rsquo;t care less what I was thinking about the international
		situation.</div>
	<div class='body'>My eyes re-acquired her ass like laser sites
		and Admiral &nbsp;Ballsy began struggling against my inseam.</div>
	<div class='body'>How ironic is that? &nbsp;For months going on
		years the wife&rsquo;s ass offered no tempations. &nbsp;It was
		wife-ass, period. &nbsp;And now, on the morning of the day of the
		Inaugural Ball, when I&rsquo;m about to go out that very night and
		fuck the brains out of a thirty-three or thirty-four year-old
		empowered-to-grab-cock modern female &mdash; on that morning the
		wife&rsquo;s ass decides to get back in the running.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nice ass,&rdquo; I said out loud.
		&nbsp;I gigcackled.</div>
	<div class='body'>She just kept rinsing.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nice ass,&rdquo; I repeated.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; she said.</div>
	<div class='body'>I started to hum sort of low to myself.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		See, I know what the billion or so women who will eventually read this
		book want me to say right now. &nbsp;You want me to say there was a
		part of me that felt like a boor, a rat, a <em>cad</em>&nbsp;for
		plotting to betray my lovely wife who was making me breakfast and
		whose pudendum I could have lawfully and lovingly reamed if only
		I&rsquo;d applied myself to a task involving only a small amount of
		floor-kissing and high-pitched whimpering.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		But mainly what I was thinking about that morning was how much <em>I
			didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</em>feel like a boor, a rat, or a cad. &nbsp;Not even a
		little. &nbsp;Right then I was pretty convinced that if the wife had
		shown any special interest in Admiral Ballsy, any special interest at
		all &mdash; a poke, a stroke, a touch, a bite &mdash; I would have
		brought all my hardons home to the hearth. &nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I mean, three nights before, after we left the
		diner, Parp walked me to the corner outside my building and asked me
		if I&rsquo;d changed my mind about giving Cammy the rimjob she craved.
		&nbsp;&mdash; And if you know anything about me after forty three
		chapters it&rsquo;s that I generally draw the line at tasting the
		lady&rsquo;s rectum. &nbsp;But I told him hey: if Cammy puts out just
		right? &nbsp;I might easily do the unthinkable.</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s what the wife had driven me too.</div>
	<div class='body'>So no, I didn&rsquo;t feel ashamed for thinking
		about how I was passing over Junior&rsquo;s anal virtues for the
		cock-centric fantasies of a theatre slut. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, I
		felt like I was getting back some of what the wife owed me.</div>
	<div class='body'>And look: If you&rsquo;re still out there
		tearing your blouse over my emotional retardation, you have only one
		person to blame: &nbsp;Parp.</div>
	<div class='body'>You don&rsquo;t believe me? &nbsp;This is what
		Jessica said when I told her about my wife-proof libido:
		&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go about your normal routine when you
		have friends like Tony Parp encouraging obsession.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		That&rsquo;s the opinion of <em>a professional therapist,
			licensed by the State of New York.</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>So you can condescend all you want.
		&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a free country. &nbsp;But you should know that I have
		the scientific consensus on my side.</div>
	<div class='body'>If Parp hadn&rsquo;t promised to lend me his
		hotel/discount/fornication card and also promised to give me an alibi
		and if he hadn&rsquo;t turned a simple side screw into some bizarro
		test of my humanity I would have been gleefully balling my wife that
		Saturday morning.</div>
	<div class='body'>Instead, I just watched her ass waving at me
		and marveled at the temptation bouncing off my steely indifference.</div>
