	<div class="chapterSubhead">Side Tail</div>
	<div class='body'>Hey look at that. &#160;Forty-two chapters and
		I'm still not in the pants of the babe whose pants we all want me to
		be in.</div>
	<div class='body'>Sometimes I think I should have started the
		story on the night of our big date and then flashed back to the other
		stuff, like I was Ulysses or Don Draper.</div>
	<div class='body'>Taking forty-two chapters doesn't mean I have
		trouble getting laid, either. &#160;I could get laid tonight if I
		wanted to. &#160;The boys are sleeping over at Bible Camp, and well,
		it's New York City. &#160;It's summertime.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And I'm a man who is his own man. &#160;A man without a wife worth
		being loyal to. &#160;I'm not what you might call in the swing of
		doing the things you need to do to actually <em>get</em> laid in New
		York in the summertime, but all the elements are here. &#160;I just
		have to throw the switch.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Back last March though banging some side tail
		required more than a little bit of skill. &#160;Even in the big city.
		&#160;That's because back then &mdash; when I first met Cammy and we
		made our date &mdash; Junior and me still had the illusion of being a
		normal family where the wife doesn't vacation as some asshole's
		collar-wearing screw-toy.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I look back on it, I can see that getting
		the chance to work on Parp's video was a godsend &mdash; if you can
		imagine God giving enough thought to my cock's prospects to intervene
		in the affairs of New Yorkers. &#160;That video re-introduced me to a
		whole world of everyday sluts I'd only barely remembered existed.</div>
	<div class='body'>Let's run down the great shit that happened or
		almost happened while I was working on that video: &#160;First off I
		almost popped Big Crap Cynthia. &#160;Then when work on the video
		wrapped I was just a few days away from seeing Cammy with her mound
		out.</div>
	<div class='body'>I know a lot of you are wondering why I had to
		go to so much trouble for some simple urban ass. &#160;"Go to a bar.
		&#160;Find someone self-conscious about her pants maybe being too
		small. &#160;Fuck her," you're thinking.</div>
	<div class='body'>Well, fuck you. &#160;It isn't that easy.
		&#160;Not for a married guy on the Upper West Side, anyway.</div>
	<br />
	<div style="text-align: center">***</div>
	<div class='body'>So that Monday night last March when the video
		wrapped I knew what I had to do.</div>
	<div class='body'>The mission: &#160;Slam Cammy.</div>
	<div class='body'>The mission in detail: &#160;Get a convincing
		alibi for that Saturday night. &mdash; And slam Cammy.</div>
	<div class='body'>I got some help with the alibi from an unlikely
		place. &#160;- Maybe not so unlikely, once you look back on it.
		&#160;Good ol' Parp was ready to help me out big time. &#160;He had
		some Gold Card membership at the New York Roundabout Inn and he let me
		use it to reserve a room.</div>
	<div class='body'>That way, no charges on my own card that the
		wife might notice.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I told Cammy about the deal with Parp's
		card, she said: &#160;"So...is he going to be there too?"</div>
	<div class='body'>It miffed me a little that she would think even
		jokingly of a three-way with Parp, but I just smiled.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then she giggled and that fried me. &#160;I was
		this far from telling her if she wanted to fuck Parp she could just,
		you know...</div>
	<div class='body'>Nahhh...I wasn't that far from telling her jack
		shit.</div>
	<div class='body'>But still. &#160;"No fucking way he's going to
		be there."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Okay."</div>
	<div class='body'>She sounded chastised, so I guess I maybe let a
		little too much disgust leak out. &#160;But fuck. &#160;I really
		sweated to get this date out of her and what does she do? &#160;She
		goes and puts an image in my head of Parp's cock swinging wild.</div>
	<div class='body'>The conversation ended okay but when I calmed
		down I was still a little on the anxious side of curious: &#160;Why
		was Parp helping me? &#160;What was his game? &#160;Was he being my
		pal or was he up to no fucking good?</div>
	<div class='body'>So Wednesday at around one in the morning right
		after my shift at the Commodore let out I met him at the City Diner at
		Ninetieth and Broadway. &#160;It was three days before the Inaugural
		Ball (which is what I always call my first fuck of a new babe).</div>
	<div class='body'>"I kind of see you facing this gray existence,"
		he said when I asked him what was in it for him to help me out.
		&#160;"You have no poetic dimension to your soul. &#160;You have a
		stupid laugh. &#160;Physically, you range from the non-descript to the
		pallid and paunchy. &#160;You live in that same square world with all
		the other dying men trying to eat their cake and have it, too.
		&#160;This could be your last chance at something wild and real."</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I just held my face in my hands. &#160;It's like he doesn't
		even know <em>how</em> to be uncruel. &#160;It's like he isn't human.
		&#160;That little creature that bursts out of John Hurt's chest in <em>Alien?</em>
		&#160;It looks a little like Parp.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Then he said: "Now that you're fighting to be
		free of said gray existence, I want to be part of the liberation."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Like when you let Kurt Libby bang Desiree
		Skarsgaard in your apartment?"</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp was eating a salad and a cup of coffee or
		maybe a glass of water. &#160;I'm not sure because I try not to watch
		Parp while he eats. &#160;"You know about me and Libby and my
		apartment and the Norwegian girl?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Yep. &#160;He told me they always used to
		laugh about the fact that you have like a dozen pillows on your bed."
	</div>
	<div class='body'>"More like four. &#160;And yeah, I was thinking
		the same thing about him back then: married to a slut we all know was
		fucking his brains out until she found Jesus and grew a chaperone out
		of her ass. &#160;And who did he have to keep him company while the
		wife was off unlearning to love the taste of penis? &#160;Two stupid
		cats."</div>
	<div class='body'>Actually, Libby was really into his wife, even
		if she was, like Parp said, going through the moral equivalent of
		dick-taste withdrawal. &#160;&#160;All he wanted was a little tail on
		the side. &#160;But in Parp's mind that got turned into <em>Les Miserables</em>
		and he wanted to be a part of it so he helped Libby out.</div>
	<div class='body'>And now me.</div>
	<div class='body'>I know. &#160;Sounds screwy. &#160;And if it
		was anybody else I would have been convinced he was up to no good.
		&#160;But I've known Parp since the Sex Pistols were a band and this
		was vintage.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was kind of relieved.</div>
	<div class='body'>And you know: &#160;when you're relieved you
		get convivial sometimes. &#160;At least I do. &#160;I put a french fry
		in my mouth (I was eating a burger and fries) and gigcackled.</div>
	<div class='body'>"So you think Cammy's a better match for me
		than Junior?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Why do you have to ruin my salad with a
		question like that?" he asked. &#160;"Some middle-class, compatibility
		question. &#160;A 'match' for you. &#160;Please."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Well-"</div>
	<div class='body'>
		"Maybe she's <em>dangerous</em> for you. &#160;Maybe you'll give up
		everything for her and then come home and catch her riding some guy's
		face."
	</div>
	<div class='body'>"Terrific."</div>
	<div class='body'>I ate more fries. &#160;I was sullen. &#160;Now
		I knew it was already in Parp's head that my new babe would be in bed
		with someone else as soon as my back was turned. &#160;He didn't say
		that someone else was him, but fuck, I know how Parp-mind works.</div>
	<div class='body'>"I barely know the girl," he said like he could
		hear me thinking. &#160;"I like her work though. &#160;She's really
		committed."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Work? &#160;What work?"</div>
	<div class='body'>Turns out Cammy &mdash; in addition to being
		the artistic director of this Milestone Theatre Company &mdash; is
		also an actress.</div>
	<div class='body'>"Whoa," I said. &#160;"I didn't know."</div>
	<div class='body'>
		"I saw her play Luise Miller in <em>Kabale Und Liebe</em> in 2004.
		&#160;She let the part take her over all the way down to the
		fast-twitch fibers. &#160;That takes a lot of discipline."
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		"I know. &#160;<em>I'm</em> an actor."
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		He shrugged. &#160;"You're not <em>that</em> kind of an actor," he
		said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>"Wait a minute. &#160;That was almost a decade
		ago."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Yeah."</div>
	<div class='body'>"How old is she?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Oh...I don't know. &#160;I guess she's got to
		be thirty-three, thirty-four."</div>
	<div class='body'>Holy shit. &#160;I thought she was in her
		twenties. &#160;This being in her thirties and an artistic director
		and an actress that Parp thinks does great work...I wasn't so sure I
		was up for this.</div>
	<div class='body'>Look, I know that admitting this doesn't make
		me look great, but the truth is &mdash; and I'm pretty sure I'm not
		surprising you &mdash; all I wanted was what Libby wanted that time:
		some side tail.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		You know side tail? &#160;It's <em>tail</em> on the <em>side</em>.
		&#160;I didn't want to be some guy in a French film who gets his soul
		consumed by burning beauty. &#160;I wanted my cock consumed by
		treadmill ass, like in an <em>American</em> film.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>That's the way I thought it was going to be
		with Cammy. &#160;A fun fuck. &#160;An American fuck. &#160;Maybe a
		short series of fun American fucks. &#160;Now it's like she's as big a
		workaholic as...well...as Parp. &#160;What if she's wound just as
		tight as he is? &#160;What if...</div>
	<div class='body'>Wait a minute.</div>
	<div class='body'>I kind of glared at him. &#160;He gave me this
		big grin, the shit.</div>
	<div class='body'>What was going on here? &#160;First, he puts in
		my head this image of Cammy in bed with some other guy.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Then he says he barely knows her, but a second later he's raving about
		a live theatre performance he saw her in back in Bush's first term!
		&#160;And she's working on his video now? &#160;Just how well <em>do</em>
		they know each other? &#160;And the whole reason we were meeting
		tonight was because Cammy put in my head the possibility of a
		three-way with Parp!
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I could feel a bloom of sweat evaporate off my
		face.</div>
	<div class='body'>I glowered at him. &#160;He stopped grinning.</div>
	<div class='body'>"What?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"If I didn't know any better," I said, "I'd
		think you were making a play for her through me. &#160;You know, in
		the hopes that I'll tell her about what a great guy you are for
		helping us out. &#160;Soften her up for you later."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Well, first off, don't you think that would
		have to be one long, cool, calculation on my part? &#160;And second,
		why would I ever expect you to speak well of me behind my back?
		&#160;And third, if I wanted to fuck Cameron, why wouldn't I talk to
		her instead of you? &#160;This isn't high school."</div>
	<div class='body'>"That answer sounds just a little too-well
		prepared," I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>He dropped his fork and sat back in the booth
		and stared up at the ceiling.</div>
	<div class='body'>I continued. "Maybe you're not telling her
		yourself because you know there's no way she'd want to be with a
		fucking egomaniac like you."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Really? &#160;Because I have this theory that
		all people who do really good work are egomaniacs."</div>
	<div class='body'>"Bullshit."</div>
	<div class='body'>"How else are they going to protect their
		standards?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Yeah, well that isn't Cammy."</div>
	<div class='body'>"You're sure?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"No. &#160;Fucking. &#160;Way. &#160;- And I
		resent you saying I never say anything good about you behind your
		back. &#160;Yeah, I say shitty things about you sometimes, but always
		to your face."</div>
	<div class='body'>He looked at me. &#160;"Yeah, okay. &#160;That
		might have been going too far."</div>
	<div class='body'>"No shit," I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>There was this long time while we just sat
		there and chomped. &#160;I have this vivid memory of a napkin bunched
		up and soaking with ketchup.</div>
	<div class='body'>"So you're just doing this for the romance of
		it all?" I finally asked, trying to get back to the point.</div>
	<div class='body'>"Doing...?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Helping me with the hotel Saturday."</div>
	<div class='body'>
		"Well, I'm <em>not</em> just doing it for the romance of it all.
		&#160;I figure if you hook up with someone like Cameron she might
		throw your personality into crisis. &#160;And when that happens, you
		might start to question your square precepts. &#160;Look at the world
		with new eyes. &#160;Make new connections between the objects you see.
		&#160;Become a real human able to see things like 'love' and 'passion'
		in their mother-ship-size dimensions, blue and blazing, instead of
		what you are now, which is one of those apes throwing sticks at the
		monolith at the beginning of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>."
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Okay, look: I know that Parp was being a big
		asshole here. &#160;Can we agree on that? &#160;But I didn't think he
		was making it up to cover a play for my new babe. &#160;I was pretty
		sure this was more vintage Parp, seeing rotating rainbows in a casual
		bang.</div>
	<div class='body'>"So it's all for me," I said. &#160;"There's
		nothing in it for you?"</div>
	<div class='body'>"Sure there is. &#160;This Saturday when you're
		fucking Cameron, I'm going to be at your house fucking your wife."</div>
	<div class='body'>I laughed. &#160;He laughed.</div>
	<div class='body'>I felt relieved.</div>
</div>
