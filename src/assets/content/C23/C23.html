        If I didn&rsquo;t want Cammy to flake on me the
        way Moira did then I&rsquo;d have to show up on the set the next 
        day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing up on the set meant I had to get Parp to <em>let</em>
        me show up, and ever since he stormed out of the bar it was in the
        back of my head that I was going to have to call him on the phone
        and eat shit.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But...full disclosure?&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew that eating shit 
        probably wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>that</em>
        bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp was a sucker for
        a good, self-deprecating gigcackle and I had a throat full of them.
        So before I got off the bus I decided, yeah, call up the ol&rsquo;
        Parp and gigcackle my way through something he might think was me
        eating the ol&rsquo; shit.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        In this day and age of cell phones you
        don&rsquo;t have to actually get up the stairs before you dial
        somebody up.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t even have to wait to get off the bus.
        But I figured waiting to call Parp from the stoop to my apartment
        building would give me the time I needed to think it through and
        maybe time for Parp to cool off if he still needed to cool
        off.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So when I got to my stoop I sat down on the cold
        concrete and dialed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It rang a couple times before he picked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But he did pick up.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good sign.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey Paul,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another good
        sign.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, when I heard my name I knew that the shit was as
        good as eaten.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something I know from decades of Parp nuttiness is
        that if he hates your guts he won&rsquo;t say your name.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
        he&rsquo;d just said &ldquo;hello&rdquo; I would have known my
        shit-eating session was going to consist of actual
        grovelling.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey Tony,&rdquo; I gigcackled.
        &ldquo;Sorry things got a little carried away there in the 
        ol&rsquo; bar...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah, me too,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So 
        you wanna show up tomorrow and Monday?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        <em>Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!</em>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait.&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday 
        too?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a three-day shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we
        should be done on Monday before your shift at the 
        Tavern.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I can be tired for
        that shift.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, you know what I was thinking?&nbsp;&nbsp; Libby told me that
        he rented the cars on one of your shoots.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how he got 
        his one producer credit in IMDB.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        No shit: that idea about renting the cars?&nbsp;&nbsp; It
        exploded into my brain a split-second before it came out of my
        mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a skill that comes from decades of needing an
        excuse on a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; Parp said. 
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did the car rental on <em>Bending
            Mrs. Franklin</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I paid today&rsquo;s rental already.&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; 
        Had to have someone else drive though.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp doesn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s
        license.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So how about this,&rdquo; I said.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rent the vans tomorrow and pick one up 
        myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;There are four vans.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        That&rsquo;s going to come to a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, it&rsquo;s
        going to come to more than your wages for today&rsquo;s work, so I
        don&rsquo;t think Junior is going to much like your footing the 
        bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, then how about
        we go with your original plan?&nbsp;&nbsp; I promise to give you back my check
        for today&rsquo;s acting gig when SAG sends it and you make me a
        producer and I show up tomorrow to, I don&rsquo;t know, protect my 
        investment.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Great!&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        could you do me a favor?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You bringing up the vans kind of reminded
        me we&rsquo;re short a driver tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you pick one up and
        drive it to the set tomorrow morning?&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be a big 
        help.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be there at...?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Eight is good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick it up at the garage on
        Seventy-Fourth and Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s under my name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive it to 
        Vider&rsquo;s club and stay for the shoot.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;See you then.&nbsp;&nbsp; And thanks!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I mentally checked the box next to &ldquo;eat
        shit&rdquo; and bounded up the stairs.
