    <div class="body">
        Junior had just started giving me another semi-whispering earful of what an asshole Hed was when the boys got up and started
        roaring around the apartment like life really <em>is</em> &nbsp;an adventure. &nbsp;It just then occurred to me that it wasn&rsquo;t
        going to be easy to distract them from Daddy&rsquo;s computer activity after Mommy left. &nbsp;I knew that to get
        in trouble I didn&rsquo;t need the kids to actually see the actual email or even know I was doing anything wrong&hellip;
        &nbsp;all I needed to do was act like I was focused on something more important than they are. &nbsp;Something that
        makes me shoo them away. &nbsp;If I did that and the wife heard about it, she was going to wonder what I was up to.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And if Junior wondered what I was up to? &nbsp;She was going to rummage. &nbsp;And I didn&rsquo;t want Junior rummaging.
        &nbsp;Rummaging Junior ultimately leads to sobbing Junior who looks up at me one day when I walk in the door. &nbsp;You
        know the scene. &nbsp;I described it already. &nbsp;&ldquo;You <em>asshole!</em> &rdquo; she screams.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then the lawyer and the daddy-free beach house.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So Junior finally split for her job managing the wait staff at MoHum, leaving the boys in a sort of jet-fueled, energy-plastered
        vibration.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I figured I&rsquo;d have them do the dishes and that would take their eyes away from the direction of whatever it was I was
        doing.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And at first it seemed to work. &nbsp;When I said, &ldquo;Make &lsquo;em sparkle, boys!&rdquo; did they complain, whine,
        pout?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Not my boys. &nbsp;My boys are too smart for that. &nbsp;They stopped flinging whatever it was they were flinging and went
        right over to the sink like they&rsquo;d just read the section of the dish-washing manual that describes how two
        young boys should split up the work.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I rose from the table and went over to the desk with the computer on it. &nbsp;But just as I was easing into the chair behind
        the desk, Sammy ran over to me and said: &nbsp;&ldquo;Daddy, can I watch <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle?</em>&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        No kidding. &nbsp; <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle</em>. &nbsp;This cartoon from the fifties that I used to watch with my sister in the
        seventies? &nbsp;It was a thing again, complete with Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sammy, are the dishes sparkling? &nbsp;Huh?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Just then I heard the gentle crash of silverware being tipped from one plastic crate into another plastic crate.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I looked over at Harry next to the sink. &nbsp;All of the dishes that used to be in the big white basin were now dripping
        wet in the black drainer.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he shouted gleefully, drying his hands on this big green-and-white dish towel we have that looks like
        it could be a beach blanket for munchkins.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;The dishes,&rdquo; he said to me slowly. &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Apparently I wasn&rsquo;t quick enough on the uptake.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Can we watch <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle</em> &nbsp;now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I almost said no. &nbsp;I almost said, &ldquo;Get back to those dishes you kids and do more than rinse this time.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I mean, I&rsquo;m a parent for Christ&rsquo;s sake! &nbsp;I have parental impulses. &nbsp;And I think those impulses are
        in the main the correct impulses.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But fortunately the incorrect impulses gripped me before I could make the morning about sparkling dishes instead of about
        reading Cammy&rsquo;s email with the word that looked like &ldquo;shtump&rdquo; in it.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The boys were offering to go off and mind their own business! &nbsp;And I almost said no!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Go ahead, boys, watch the dynamic duo defend freedom from the commies!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Moose and squirrel!&rdquo; Sammy cried, and they ran off to their room to download a cartoon from this website which
        &mdash; according to Junior &mdash; had every old <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle</em> &nbsp;episode ever made.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
    <em>Hmmm</em>, I thought. &nbsp; <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle. &nbsp;Sounds like a cover story</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But I decided to find out what the boys were really up to on some other day. &nbsp;Right then I just sat there facing the
        living room PC and reached for the mouse.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I. &nbsp;Was alone. &nbsp;Kinda.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I clicked on the Cammy email and this is what I saw:
    </div>
    <div class="body">
    <em>Shtudhump</em>,
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Did I mention I just loved the taste of Admiral Ballsilicious</em>?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>That&rsquo;s his name, right?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>I was looking all over that lil email of yers for an invite to a jump n&rsquo; pump, but I didn&rsquo;t see one. *sniff sniff*</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <em>Cam</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
    <em>btw &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been keeping my hiney nice and tight just fer you. &nbsp;Didja like it?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Um, yuh!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I emailed her back ASAP. &nbsp;Ayyyy-Sapppppp. &nbsp;I made sure she knew I noticed her hiney was tight and that I liked
        it. &nbsp; And &nbsp;that I was game for a jump n&rsquo; pump. &nbsp;Anytime. &nbsp;Just name the time. &nbsp;Now,
        for example. &nbsp; <em>The kids can even watch and Junior can come home and sob while I ball you</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That&rsquo;s what I was thinking anyway. &nbsp;I sent her an email back. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to print the contents
        of that email because I&rsquo;m afraid that thinking about what I wrote in it will make me feel stupid for some reason.
        &nbsp;&mdash; Like when I typed up that first email I sent. &nbsp;Except that then? &nbsp;I felt stupid instantly
        after sending it to her.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I guess I&rsquo;m just tired of feeling stupid.
    </div>
    <div class="body" style="text-align: center">
        ***
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I got an email back from her maybe five minutes later, while I was browsing my Twitter feed.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Fuck date number two was on! &nbsp;And even better? &nbsp;It was for <em>three weeks from now</em>. &nbsp;She was all &ldquo;sorry
        but I&rsquo;m going out of town with the BF to his family reunion but when I get home I swallow Admiral Ballsitude.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
    <em>No prob</em>, I thought. &nbsp; <em>I&rsquo;ll use the time to get the Admiral in shape</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Why are you so happy Daddy?&rdquo; Harry asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I looked up. &nbsp;He giggled.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He was out of his room! &nbsp;And so was Sammy! &nbsp;They&rsquo;d crept out like good little evil spies, without making
        a sound!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s happy!&rdquo; said Sam.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; &nbsp;I said. &nbsp;I looked grim.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But you were smiling and dancing around.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, no, I was just thinking of all the things I have to do today and I was getting a little nervous.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Do the dance again, Daddy!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Time for school, boys!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Awwwww...&rdquo; whined Harry.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; said the other one.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The rest of the day? &nbsp;Like I said before: it was pretty great. &nbsp;And nobody squealed on me later for being happy.
    </div>
