        No More Wheaty Charms

        I look back on that day now and it was a great
        day.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the start of something big that I screwed up weeks
        later because I trusted Parp and he sabotaged me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Ahhhhh ...I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I fucked it up all by
        myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I&rsquo;m ...
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Nah, it was Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabotaging
        me, selling me out, sinking my hopes, stabbing me in the back.
        These are all hobbies of Parp&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than hobbies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Avocations</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re thinking.
        &ldquo;The people in your life have nothing better to do, I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<em>sure</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Well, you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just don&rsquo;t know
        Parp and how much of a life he doesn&rsquo;t have.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t
        think he takes the time to plan out how he&rsquo;s going to fuck me
        over?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Like I said: you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, the guy is
        fucking my wife while I&rsquo;m typing this, all right?&nbsp;&nbsp;What more
        do you want?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So right now my life eats monkey balls.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started
        coughing today.&nbsp;&nbsp;An old-man, smoker&rsquo;s hack that started me
        obsessing on the odds I&rsquo;ll get cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day back in
        March.&nbsp;&nbsp;That day at Hannibal&rsquo;s Demise.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Cammy and Bang and
        Lenny and Bobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a great day.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Jessica says one of the reasons I have so many 
        lousy days is I &nbsp;<em>expect</em>
        each day to be lousy.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why not try this,&rdquo; she said about a
        year, maybe two years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just &ndash; when you get up in
        the morning?&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; this is what some people do: they start out
        assuming every day is going to be a great day until they, you know,
        something happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just ...not every day is going to be
        great but at least when you start each day you&rsquo;re giving it
        the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp;You think you might want to give that a
        try?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Sounds great, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried it for a
        few days, and yeah, it kind of worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled a bunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and Sam
        went out on walks while the wife was at work and Harry was at
        school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I trundled him around Riverside Park and smiled real shiny
        at all the hot single mommies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great day!&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t it?
        Smile!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s in a good mood!&rdquo; one
        of them said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s a great day!&rdquo; I
        yelled back.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The boy laughed a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was great.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I
        mentioned we&rsquo;re pals.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three of us are out,
        that&rsquo;s the Man Squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;When two of us are out, that&rsquo;s
        the Man Quorum.&nbsp;&nbsp;I even invented a new breakfast for the Squad:
        Wheaty Charms.&nbsp;&nbsp;See, Mommy doesn&rsquo;t want them eating Lucky
        Charms so I invented Wheaties with a Lucky Charms frosting, you
        know?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I&rsquo;m the good guy!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But, you know, shit comes down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicks
        you&rsquo;re not supposed to be balling tell you to stop balling
        them and you can&rsquo;t complain because they could tell the wife
        and you could get divorced and only see the Man Squad every other
        weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank calls up because the co-op mortgage is late and
        the wife is pissed off and you&rsquo;re a nobody bartender with
        some clippings waiting on asshole actors who have careers and
        hanging with Kurt Libby the loser and Tony Parp the prick and
        meanwhile in just a few decades you&rsquo;ll be either dead or some
        old man showing his incisions off to strangers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But yeah, give every day the benefit of the
        doubt.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        You tell yourself, &ldquo;Be in the moment,
        I&rsquo;m a trained actor, I can do that, look at the lovely shine
        on this porcelain plate, is there anything lovelier?&rdquo; And you
        hate yourself for being such a happy-pill-gulping, Chopra-quoting ,
        mantra-chanting monkey.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Maybe some Zen will fix it ...there is no ego,
        there is no linear thought, it&rsquo;s all an illusion.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then you make the mistake of telling Parp and he
        says, &ldquo;Zen is just another slave philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all Eastern
        religions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give up your ego and reach a higher plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what
        the higher plane is?&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re finally content
        to sit on your knees and never look up unless it&rsquo;s to kiss
        the tax-collector&rsquo;s ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you ask why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that makes
        you a linear-thinking ego-haver.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to be one of
        those, do you?&nbsp;&nbsp;No?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ...pucker up and no
        questions!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And pretty soon the whole
        give-each-day-the-benefit-of-the-doubt attitude is something that
        lasts for the first five minutes of each day until the wife says,
        &ldquo;No more Wheaty Charms.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;But &mdash; &rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;No more Wheaty Charms!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Still, that first day of shooting &nbsp;<em>Little
            Round Jewish Hat</em>?&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a great day and I had no idea while
        it was happening.
