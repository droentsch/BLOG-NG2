	<div class='body'>A lot later in the day I got to hear Vider say
		this:&nbsp;&ldquo;What I frickin&rsquo; can&rsquo;t stand is the woman
		who wants to jump from the friend phase right to the nag phase without
		the intervening fuck phase.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>He was sitting at a piano on the stage in the
		club right after the shoot was over for the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody
		who hadn&rsquo;t left already was either just sitting out at the
		tables staring at the people on the stage, or on the stage staring at
		the people sitting at the tables.</div>
	<div class='body'>I guess there were about fifteen of
		us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vider had shut the kitchen down for the day so the only
		coffee you could get was the tepid crap from the almost-empty Dunkin
		Donuts boxes on some of the tables.</div>
	<div class='body'>Belinda&rsquo;s hipster boyfriend had swung by
		to pick her up about three hours before so she was long
		gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny Paine was still there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispers and
		Parp and Vider and Bang were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;So were these young
		chicks with really tight asses who played the dancing strippers in the
		&ldquo;Soho Strip&rdquo; riff, the part of the video where they all
		come sliding down poles that magically appear on the sidewalk while
		Lenny is singing about how great it is to have his yarmulke back.</div>
	<div class='body'>These chicks were all Black or Cuban or dark
		Puerto Rican maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Dominican.</div>
	<div class='body'>The &ldquo;Soho Strip&rdquo; riff was what they
		were shooting that day at the club.&nbsp;&nbsp;They shot this big
		splashy song-and-dance bit in front of a green screen and Vider got
		the dancers cheap.</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp was leaning against Vider&rsquo;s piano
		and Whispers was sitting on the floor of the stage next to
		him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang was sitting on the edge of the stage with his
		legs dangling off like he was a kid on the edge of a pier.</div>
	<div class='body'>After Vider&rsquo;s mini-rant about chicks
		skipping from the friend-phase to the nag-phase without having the
		decency to fuck him, Lenny said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, if you don&rsquo;t
		fuck, don&rsquo;t nag.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So who nags?&rdquo; said the dancing
		stripper sitting right next to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just
		fuck.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Bang said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Awright!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Everybody just sort of shut up and looked at
		Bang for a sec.&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugged.</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled at his discomfort.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The chick next to me who said &ldquo;I just
		fuck&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the gigcackle and smiled at me and
		I&rsquo;m thinking, <em>see, some babes love the way I laugh</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I was thinking I might have an opportunity here
		even though dancers kind of scare me.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a
		well-known backstage universal that dancers will make you eat their
		cunts all night and whiplash your neck with their dancer-thighs every
		time they pop.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You funny,&rdquo; she said to me, almost
		in a whisper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You like my boyfriend.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So do you really just fuck?&rdquo; I
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Look at you,&rdquo; she giggled.
		&ldquo;You married and old enough to be my daddy and you still
		bad.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Nobody else was listening to
		us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vider sat at the piano and whenever anyone cracked wise
		he would play a chord or a snatch of a melody.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody
		ordered pizza about an hour before so there were a bunch of open pizza
		boxes.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Are you hitting on Mallory?&rdquo; Parp
		called over to me when he saw me chatting with the I-just-fuck babe.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Trying my best.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you
		bother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wife is tasty.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Vider perked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh
		yeah?&nbsp;&nbsp;Parpie says your wife is tasty, is she?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Tastes like a wife,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>A lot of oooos from the dancing strippers.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You sick,&rdquo; said Mallory.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying she isn&rsquo;t
		tasty,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But, you know, we&rsquo;ve
		been together ten years.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>One of the dancing strippers jumped up and
		headed to the bathroom.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Men suck!&rdquo; she said as she slammed
		the door.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, hey,&rdquo; I whined in a way I
		hoped would be taken for pitiful, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing, but, you
		know, the wife is...&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Not impressed you&rsquo;re a
		producer?&rdquo; Whispers asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>Everybody guffawed.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Whoa.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the blue it was yet <em>another</em> babe in
		hot pants.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was standing against the wall by the stage.
		She giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else laughed.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You made Paul&rsquo;s night,&rdquo;
		Vider said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>More laughs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wished Cammy was
		there but this new babe was looking right at me.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;You <em>real</em> sick,&rdquo; Mallory said.
