		Man Mood
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I know I said this before but it&rsquo;s really important for you to remember that in about twelve hours I was scheduled to bone a babe about fifteen years younger than me. &nbsp;So I had a mood to protect. &nbsp;A man mood. &nbsp;You boys? &nbsp;You know this mood. &nbsp;It is the mood that says you deserve what you&rsquo;re about to pound.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I call it the <em>Gimme That</em>&nbsp;mood.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		At the beginning of the day my mood was large with Gimme That. &nbsp;But now I was sitting in the park with my two boys after getting yelled at by a stranger and Gimme That was yielding to something dark and small and scared.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I didn&rsquo;t have a name for it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		See, Dandy Boy caught me off guard. &nbsp;Completely. &nbsp;Like he&rsquo;d happened on me drunk and standing on one foot. &nbsp;Why was I this vulnerable? &nbsp;Because it never occurred to me that me and the boys could offend a stranger just by the way we ate our lunch. &nbsp;I still think he was a prick for yelling at me but he got me ruminating on how I might be giving off a smell or a look or a sound or a <em>vibe</em>&nbsp;that I had no idea I was giving off and that made people want to turn on me.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The thought that I might be communicating on some animal level things that I have absolutely no control over started spooking me. &nbsp;What if Cammy jumped up and called me a lip-smacking peasant?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		What if she laughed at me and wouldn&rsquo;t tell me why?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And then I thought: &ldquo;Shit, is this the cleanest shirt I&rsquo;ve got? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m in public for fuck sake!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Then I started thinking about all the guys out there who could out-fuck me. &nbsp;And about how out of shape I was and how I didn&rsquo;t take cock-hardening drugs and how my abs really <em>did</em>&nbsp;suck, just like Parp said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Daddy?&rdquo; &nbsp;Harry asked.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. &nbsp;Daddy&rsquo;s got to leave for his shift in a few minutes, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;But why are you sad?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was petrified. &nbsp;I nearly crapped my pants. &nbsp;<em>Even the boys are picking up the vibe</em>, I thought.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Is there anything scarier than that? &nbsp;I mean, other than maybe finding out your wife and mom have been able to read your mind all along?
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Finish up your lunch, boys. &nbsp;Your lives await.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Shit. &nbsp;My mouth was on auto-pilot.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		They stared at me. &nbsp;I stood up and paced away.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		The pack. &nbsp;The lighter. &nbsp;Flick, flick, suck, ahhhh...
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Then the sneaky look-around. &nbsp;Smoking in Riverside Park is not what you would call legal anymore, but mainly you just get yelled at by non-smokers with no futures and sad childhoods if they catch you doing it. &nbsp;I could see two other people smoking. &mdash; Fat guy tossing the tennis ball up and down, young mommy with stroller looking harried and cold on a bench by herself. &mdash; No one was giving them shit for it, so I figured I was safe.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Sammy got off the bench and started for me.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Sammy, you done eating?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		He stopped mid-stride. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Finish eating?&rdquo; &nbsp;He gave me this grin like he was waiting for a gold star.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;So Sammy. &nbsp;Sit back down and finish.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Retard,&rdquo; Harry said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And right then the phone rings and I look down and the ol&rsquo; caller ID says TONY PARP in big white letters and I&rsquo;m relieved. &nbsp;Thankful for a shot at some camaraderie.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hey Tone,&rdquo; I said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hey Paul, guess what I just did on the Internet.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I dunno... Play a game or something?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		My mouth was still on autopilot.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I just read Belinda McElroy&rsquo;s blog.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Belinda McElroy? Who...Oh yeah. &nbsp;Big-butt Belinda. &nbsp;I saw her blog that one time when I was checking out her ass. &nbsp;I sort of remembered that she wrote stuff on it too...
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Suddenly my shoulders and back seized up, the way they do when you&rsquo;ve been caught outright doing the bad. &nbsp;I knew there was something about me and big-butt that I didn&rsquo;t want to get back to Parp but I couldn&rsquo;t remember what it was.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wednesday she posted this entry. &nbsp;You should read it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s about this guy who gave her a ride into Manhattan to shoot stills for a video. &nbsp;And this guy &mdash; what a schmuck! &mdash; wanted to know what made a girl like her pose naked on the Internet.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Oh yeah. &nbsp;That was it.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;And she goes on to say that he wanted to know because he was the concerned father of two boys.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Pause.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Oh fuck,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well...fuck.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I kinda think I asked you explicitly not to bring that up to her. &nbsp;I mean, I asked you to do that as a favor and you said &lsquo;okay.&rsquo; &nbsp;And the very next day this one thing I asked you not to say to her? &nbsp;You went ahead and said it to her. &nbsp;Now I suppose she thinks I hired her for her ass.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Oh right. &nbsp;Like that would be the farthest thing from your mind.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I heard him sigh. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such an asshole.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;And speaking of favors, I kind of asked you to do <em>me</em>&nbsp;a favor and call me a producer for a day and you used that to extort a day&rsquo;s wages out of me.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Yeah, minus the SAG deductions and worker&rsquo;s comp and taxes we have to pay. By the way, did you get that check yet? &nbsp;Because until you actually give me the check you haven&rsquo;t produced anything.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I get it next week, asshole.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Sixty seconds into the conversation and already we&rsquo;d both played the asshole card. &nbsp;Not exactly what I was hoping when I picked up.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I sat down on one of those stone posts on the side of a pathway. &nbsp;Froze my ass on contact. &nbsp;Right through my corduroys. &nbsp;I stubbed out what was left of my illicit cigarette and let it crumble to the ground.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;So what is this all about really?&rdquo; I asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you calling me about this now? &nbsp;Are you backing out?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Of our alibi deal. &nbsp;Are you still covering for me tonight? &nbsp;Or is this rant your way of saying the deal is off.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Hahahahaaaaa...&rdquo; he laughed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Getting cold feet?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Jesus...&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m not going to be your excuse for backing down. &nbsp;&mdash; Hope you&rsquo;ve been doing your dick exercises.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Dick exercises?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Uh-oh,&rdquo; he laughed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shitty abs, toothpick arms, limp cock. &nbsp;My condolences to the lady!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I almost threw the iPhone down in the dirt.
	</div>
