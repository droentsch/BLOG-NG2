        Cammy wasn&rsquo;t there!&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Plus</em>
        I forgot
        to pick up the van I said I&rsquo;d get!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The whole day sucked gorilla mound.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting the van made me a dick.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        There&rsquo;s no escaping it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Mea culpa</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; But being a dick 
        wasn&rsquo;t <em>totally</em>
        my fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; See, when I get up in the
        morning it isn&rsquo;t like when Parp gets up.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Parp gets up he
        just has to shave and brush his teeth and split.&nbsp;&nbsp; Me, on the other
        hand, I have to do that fighting-for-the-bathroom schtick with two 
        sons and a wife who&rsquo;s <em>really</em>
        pissed because I
        can&rsquo;t convince her I didn&rsquo;t know all along that
        I&rsquo;d have to do this for three days instead of one.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a producer, hon!&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp begged me
        and fuck, I couldn&rsquo;t say no!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        She sipped at her coffee and said nothing, like
        my reasoning wasn&rsquo;t good enough to deserve an audible reply.
        When we were younger and she pouted like that I always ended up 
        begging her to engage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ya know?&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Stop making me guess what you
            think!</em>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I guess you can say no to me and your kids
        though,&rdquo; she finally said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can say no to your 
        family on a Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Gotta go.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not leaving until you explain
        to your children why they don&rsquo;t get a father this 
        weekend.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain when I get 
        home.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll explain now!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why are you going, Daddy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Harry
        asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I get to ride on your shoulders to 
        church?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He started to sob.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Sammy started blubbering.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Jesus, what a pair of pussies!
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I started to explain it to them but I figured out
        fast that a cheap bribe would be quicker and easier.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey boys, I&rsquo;ll tell ya.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get
        home?&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese pizza!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I made for the door while Junior muttered
        something with that flat &ldquo;a&rdquo; sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, like 
        &ldquo;asshole&rdquo; or &ldquo;bastard.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        <em>That&rsquo;s</em>
        what I had to go through to
        get downtown to Vider&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s why I forgot all about
        the van until I was approximately five steps away from the front
        door of Vider&rsquo;s club.&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured I&rsquo;d go back uptown and
        get the damn thing, but since that would make me an extra hour late
        I walked into Vider&rsquo;s to find Parp and tell him what I was up
        to.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He was standing with Bang and Whispers and some
        of the crew and George Vider at the piano over by the stage where
        they&rsquo;d cleared a lot of tables away.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few yards beyond them
        a bunch of guys were hanging another green screen while the
        assistant-director dyke watched and screamed out stuff like,
        &ldquo;I still see a shadow, retard!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I told Parp I screwed the pooch van-wise and that
        I&rsquo;d be back in an hour and plop the keys in his hand, but it
        turned out he&rsquo;d sent somebody to get it already.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So you just 
        assumed I screwed up?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;We gave it a half hour then pretty much
        the consensus was yeah, Paul screwed up.&nbsp;&nbsp; You just missed Terry.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
        split like three minutes ago.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Terry was the kid they sent uptown on the subway
        to get the van.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I kind of resent that,&rdquo; I said.
        &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t pick up the phone and call 
        me?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Tried that,&rdquo; Whispers jumped in. 
        &ldquo;Junior picked up.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I winced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so I forgot the van <em>and</em>
        the phone.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Whispers saw the wince.
        &ldquo;Ha-haaaaaaaa...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  he laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He started to slow-clap
        with his hands cupped so the sound would boom.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        What an asshole.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then Parp and Vider just started laughing really
        hard and when Bang saw Vider laughing he joined in with that
        goose-honk of his.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I was outnumbered so I added in a gigcackle.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Self-deprecating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t be trusted,
        Paul,&rdquo; Vider said.&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost never see Vider any more but when
        I do see him he always talks to me like he just saw me
        yesterday.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll get it 
        tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        They laughed some more.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was starting to piss
        me off.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;For real,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        They stopped laughing in there somewhere and Parp
        told me that they&rsquo;d let me off the hook and all would be
        forgiven if right now I would take one of the cars and drive out to
        Long Island to get Belinda, the photographer.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I thought Cammy was her ride,&rdquo; I
        said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Cameron can&rsquo;t make it today,&rdquo;
        Parp said when we were alone on the sidewalk on the way to the car. 
        &ldquo;She just called.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;The whole producer thing?&nbsp;&nbsp; All for
        naught,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But she says she&rsquo;ll be on the 
        set tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Okay, so...tomorrow...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Same deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; You give back your check from
        yesterday and you&rsquo;re a producer all three days.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you want 
        to hang around today?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;May as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s either this or 
        church.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp gave me the keys and Belinda&rsquo;s
        address.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was going to be a three hour round trip.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t take the 
        train?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She has a weird thing about trains and 
        elevators.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And just like that he turned around and walked
        back to Vider&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; No &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No
        &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Just turned around and split, like it was
        my job to chauffeur cunt for him.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That&rsquo;s when it hit me.&nbsp;&nbsp; My delayed reaction
        to the news Cammy wasn&rsquo;t going to be there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d fought
        the wife and the boo-hooing brats and got here and now it was going
        to be another agonizing twenty-four hours before I had another shot
        at her and there was no guarantee she wouldn&rsquo;t just decide to
        sleep in tomorrow, too.
