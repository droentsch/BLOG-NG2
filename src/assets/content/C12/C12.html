        Let That Be a Lesson To Ya
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;So.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The wife said, &ldquo;You can go fuck yourself anyway&rdquo; and then she just hung
        there looking at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason looking back on it I don&rsquo;t think her
        arms were folded across her bulbous tits but in my memory of the event
        that&rsquo;s where I have them.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Arms folded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mommy.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It riled me a little that she could just say &rdquo;fuck yourself&rdquo; to me and
        then look me in the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;That she didn&rsquo;t scurry off like somebody who
        knew she was being spoiled and bratty about a fight she lost fair and
        square.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I should have just let it go.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew it at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;But you know what 
        it&rsquo;s like sometimes when you&rsquo;ve won and you know you&rsquo;ve won but still it  
        didn&rsquo;t end right so you just keep talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted her to appreciate 
        firsthand that <em>I was right</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the merits and not because I was
        bull-headed and she was tired or more evolved or something.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Ya know, when I think about it,&rdquo; I said, &rdquo;I didn&rsquo;t have to do this much 
        tap-dancing for my parents when I told them I was moving to New York <em>forever</em>
        to be an actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew I was going to end up being a
        career bartender begging his fucking wife for one stinking day to live my
        dream in.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        What a pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I shouted.&nbsp;&nbsp;I whimpered.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure my eyes were 
        all wide the way the boys&rsquo; eyes get when <em>they</em>
        shout and whimper
        and plead.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It took a few sessions in therapy but I finally figured out with
        Jessica&rsquo;s help that I&rsquo;m scared of my wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was more like a few
        dozen sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I really resented Jessica for even suggesting
        that I might be scared of Junior.&nbsp;&nbsp;I resented her so much that for awhile
        I stopped fucking her in my fantasies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked down the street talking
        to myself and I smoked way more than I should have and I tried to act all
        manly in front of the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prove I wasn&rsquo;t
        scared of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she&rsquo;d furrow her brow and I&rsquo;d shout and whimper and
        plead some more.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Finally I threw in the towel and admitted it to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then me and 
        Jessica started working on getting me <em>un</em>-scared.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Jessica started appearing in my sex fantasies again.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
        real life Jessica was trying to get me to be a little more open and
        honest and blunt with the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my fantasies she was a little more
        ....&nbsp;&nbsp;mmmm ...&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>hands on</em>
        with Junior.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        In one version of my fantasy where Jessica&rsquo;s blowing me on the bedroll
        she tells me not to worry because she&rsquo;ll find the wife and beat the shit
        out of her for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a second later we&rsquo;re not on the bedroll
        anymore but in the garage of the house I used to live in when I was in
        grade school.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great because there was this little workshop in it
        with a loft and the loft had a sofa and a TV.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        In this extended version of the bedroll fantasy Jessica pounds the crap
        out of the wife with her bare fists and the wife is blubbering and
        pleading on the garage floor and Jessica stands over her wearing nothing
        but a black thong and says, &ldquo;Let that be a lesson to ya, chasm-snatch!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It&rsquo;s the best sex fantasy I ever had.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Anyway, back on the day we had the argument and I just finished shouting
        and whimpering and pleading, Junior stood there and stared for a few
        seconds and then said, &rdquo;Well, do you think you can at least tell me what
        you&rsquo;re shooting, Paul?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That was a good sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so relieved I over-explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did I 
        tell her about <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        but I also told her what 
        color t-shirt Parp was wearing that afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;That guy is <em>such</em>
        an asshole,&rdquo; I gigcackled.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It was all good.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I thought so at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife ended up
        drifting down to the bedroom. &nbsp;&nbsp;Alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving me alone.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        With my thoughts.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I quickly put on some Dylan and my big padded headphones.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I looked around and smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good.
    </div>
