	<div class="chapterSubhead">A Public Service Announcement</div>
	<div class='body'>I&rsquo;m pretty sure big-butt Belinda was
		biting Parp&rsquo;s pipe on the sly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that Parp ever admitted it.
		But I know the putz.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Parp is talking to a chick and laughing with
		her it means he&rsquo;s getting mouth.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		At <em>least</em> mouth.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>The guy&rsquo;s a misogynist.&nbsp;&nbsp;There.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
		been said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to kick his ass, ladies.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And he&rsquo;s crafty.&nbsp;&nbsp;See, when I made that run at Belinda that I
		described in the last chapter?&nbsp;&nbsp;When I did that I was running at her <em>straight
			on</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t holding anything over her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t
		intimidating her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t her boss asking for a
		&ldquo;favor.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And she shot me down <em>straight on</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>But see Parp doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of
		honesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s what he does.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a hot
		young chick.&nbsp;&nbsp;What he does is he hires you to work on one of his crummy
		little films.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t know any better so you get all grateful
		and think it&rsquo;s rock &lsquo;n roll when he tells you he really,
		really needs to put his cock in your face.</div>
	<div class='body'>But it isn&rsquo;t rock &lsquo;n roll.
		It&rsquo;s pathetic and predatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ask your boyfriend.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So ladies, watch out for the Parps.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to blow them.
		You <em>don&rsquo;t</em>.
