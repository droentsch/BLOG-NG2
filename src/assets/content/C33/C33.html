	<div class='body'>So I&rsquo;m out on the sidewalk reaching for a
		cig and out walks Cynthia about twenty seconds later.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
		just missed seeing me flip open my lighter in that nonchalant way I
		have.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a missed opportunity but I was pretty sure
		I&rsquo;d be doing it again in a few minutes.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		She walked right up to me and just stood there at
		first.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trying to hide the fact that I was looking at
		her rack but then I saw her looking up at me and baby the fuck was <em>so</em>
		on.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I thought <em>screw tact</em> and I just looked
		slowly down the front of her.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeahhhhhhh,&rdquo; she
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;She did a slow spin for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;When her back
		was to me &mdash; she was wearing short jeans that crawled up her gape
		over thick tights (oh and she was wearing leg warmers, too) &mdash;
		she kind of glanced at me over her shoulder.</div>
	<div class='body'>She said: &ldquo;You like the shit-cutter,
		hah?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I took a pull on the
		cigarette.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said on the
		exhale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to face me again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus,
		her tits were muscle balls.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You got a cigarette for me or
		what?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>It was weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right at that second I
		realized she was Dominican.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that there&rsquo;s anything
		wrong with Dominicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just, well, in the club I thought
		she was a Brooklyn-variety black chick.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		guess I was staring.</div>
	<div class='body'>I gave her the cigarette and lit her up from
		the ember on the end of mine and she looked at me and said, &ldquo;So
		you want to come home with me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hah?&nbsp;&nbsp;I live just
		up the blocks near the theatre hardware places.&nbsp;&nbsp;Know the
		places I mean?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Sorta.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hah?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You want me to suck on your dick for
		you?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That...that would be super,&rdquo; I
		said.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;<em>Super?!</em> You being sarcastic or what?!&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I pulled her over to me and said low in her
		ear: &ldquo;Sarcasm is for pussies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to fuck
		you deep, like in a prison cell.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeahhhhh...&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>We both gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she said in
		a soft voice, &ldquo;You gonna lick my holes for me?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sure am, babe.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Your wife don&rsquo;t know what she
		missing I bet.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>We shared another gigcackle.</div>
	<div class='body'>See, that&rsquo;s what I
		like.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicks who dig me and walk right up to me and lay
		their cock-sucking cards on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t
		complicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The licking-her-holes thing?&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		could make up a solid excuse for not crossing that bridge when I came
		to it.</div>
