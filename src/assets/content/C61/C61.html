    <div class="body">
        The next day was pretty great for me. &nbsp;Maybe it was two days later. &nbsp;Maybe three. &nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Look: however many days later it was? &nbsp;It was pretty great.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I woke up and made sure nobody was around and then walked really quick into the living room and dialed up the gmail
            account.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now I know a lot of you are wondering why &mdash; if I wanted to check my email &mdash; I had to do it at the family
            computer in the living room. &nbsp;And the answer is that technically? &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have to.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But think about it. &nbsp;Suppose I&rsquo;m the guy who grabs his phone off the nightstand to check for little messages
            before he even gets out of bed. &nbsp;While the wife is lying right there.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Staring.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah. &nbsp;First thing she&rsquo;s going to wonder is what I&rsquo;ve got going on that can&rsquo;t wait. &nbsp;And
            she&rsquo;s going to wonder the same thing if I&rsquo;m checking messages at the breakfast table while the kids
            need an urgent parental decision. &nbsp;Or jelly wiped out of one of those little corners between their nostrils
            and their lips.
        
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And if the wife wonders, she&rsquo;s going to ask. &nbsp;And if she asks, I&rsquo;m going to answer. &nbsp;And if
            I answer? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be a big fat lie.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So my rule is: if the fam is around I check the email at the fam&rsquo;s computer. &nbsp;Like it&rsquo;s a duty.
            &nbsp;An obligation I have to adulthood. &nbsp;Like the only new information Daddy could be expecting in his
            timid, lonely little life is a notice to pay his life insurance premium or some spam advising him of the unclaimed
            Nigerian money that could be his.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Daddy wants to dispatch this obligation early, yes, but not so early that an onlooker might consider him 
        <em>eager</em>
        .
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I looked casually at the screen to check and... yes! &nbsp;A reply from Cammy Camster McCammacam to the email
            I&rsquo;d sent her just a couple days before.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yes, the one where I called her &ldquo;Little William.&rdquo; &nbsp;The one that made me want to execute myself only
            seconds after sending it.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        At first I wasn&rsquo;t so sure about reading it. &nbsp;The subject line just said &ldquo;RE:&rdquo;, because she
            was replying to my email and &nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t put anything in the subject line.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I let it sit there for awhile with just her name and &ldquo;RE:&rdquo;. &nbsp;Then I heard the wife bumping around
            in the bedroom. &nbsp;That meant she&rsquo;d be out in a sec and the boys would be up. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have
            any time to waste so quick! &ndash; I clicked the email and saw it was &nbsp;a couple paragraphs I didn&rsquo;t
            have time to scan except to see some word that looked like &ldquo;shtump&rdquo; at the top.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So I closed the browser quick and started running the little utility that destroys the evidence. &nbsp;Junior thinks
            it&rsquo;s a virus scan that I run every day, but it&rsquo;s actually killing any little picture or tidbit or
            texty thingy that the browser leaves on the fam&rsquo;s PC that could end up making me come home one day to catch
            the wife sitting at the computer and sobbing before she looks up at my face and screams, &ldquo;You 
        <em>asshole!</em>
        &rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then she hires a lawyer to leave me for dead while she goes off to raise the boys in some daddy-free beach house.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I tried extra hard to look bored and calm when I heard Junior making her final stomp toward the bedroom door, but
            when she came out I thought something weird and non-wonderful might be going on and I may have lost some of the
            aforesaid bored-and-calm look. &nbsp;I thought: 
            <em>Maybe she got a job as an extra in some movie and she&rsquo;s been waiting to spring it on me</em>. &nbsp;And why not? &nbsp;It would be the perfect opportunity for her to play the rule card on me the way I played
            it on her a couple weeks earlier when I went to work on 
            <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        .
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I mean, she definitely wasn&rsquo;t wearing one of her usual outfits. &nbsp;She was wearing this kind of costume
            like you might see in one of those old MGM period pieces about Cleopatra or Robin Hood or Ali Baba or somebody.
            &nbsp;She looked like a slave girl with a bunch of silk scarves and wide metal bracelets on her. &nbsp;It was
            like I said: a little disconcerting. &nbsp;And before I&rsquo;d had my first coffee!
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But it turned out to be a dayjob thing. &nbsp;Junior&rsquo;s boss at the Museum of the Humanities &mdash; Ed &ldquo;Hed&rdquo;
            Borogan &mdash; had decided it would be a great idea if the wait staff dressed up like whatever characters were
            in the exhibit the museum was featuring that month. &nbsp;And if the big brass at MoHum went for it? &nbsp;They
            might make it a regular thing and Junior would be dressing up like some historical archetype every weekday.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This month&rsquo;s exhibit was of Egypt at the time of the pharaohs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;At MoHum?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Seems like more of a Museum-of-Natural-History thing,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior didn&rsquo;t call me a know-it-all or a wisenheimer or anything, but she assured me there was plenty of Museum-of-the-Humanities
            material to be had in Egypt at the time of the pharaohs.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I just stared at her. &nbsp;She was definitely looking exotic. &nbsp;In addition to the scarves and the bracelets?
            &nbsp;She was wearing this wrap-around blouse. &nbsp;The blouse was striped yellow and brown like a tiger and
            showed a lot of skin.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior&rsquo;s cleavage was supple and&hellip; 
        <em>hefting</em>
        . &nbsp;It was come-hither cleavage.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah. &nbsp;I could picture it. &nbsp;Egyptian slave girl. &nbsp;Geezer pharaoh. &nbsp;The queen out of the palace
            for the evening&hellip;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior was irritated that morning. &nbsp;Actually she was still irritated from the day before when good ol&rsquo;
            Hed told some fucktard at the museum that she was in her forties. &nbsp;The fucktard looked all shocked and said,
            &ldquo;Shit, you&rsquo;re old!&rdquo; in a really loud voice with lots of people listening and now it was a big
            joke among the waiters Junior had to manage.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And it really isn&rsquo;t fair to Junior because&hellip; she&rsquo;s a babe. &nbsp;A dish. &nbsp;And because old
            isn&rsquo;t old the way old used to be. &nbsp;Jesus, I know for a fact that if it weren&rsquo;t for my gothic
            chasm aversion &mdash; the one I told you about way back in chapter six or eight or thirteen or something? &nbsp;There&rsquo;s
            no way I&rsquo;d have Cammy in my life. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d just be looking for new and better ways to make Junior
            let me jump in her game, like they say in that tribal tune from my tribal youth.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And besides. &nbsp;I was ten years older than Junior. &nbsp;And there&rsquo;s no way 
    <em>I&rsquo;m</em>
        &nbsp;old.
