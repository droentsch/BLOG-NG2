	<div class="chapterSubhead">No Sympathy From the Devil</div>
	<div class='body'>The night of the Cynthia incident I got home
		&mdash; I&rsquo;m taking you back in time again to last March &mdash;
		and I climbed up the steps to my front door and remembered I better
		call Parp before going upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to tell him about
		the Cynthia thing and didn&rsquo;t want the wife to overhear.</div>
	<div class='body'>Logical, right?</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So for the second night in a row I&rsquo;m out there on my stoop
		dialing up the old phone to call Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, Parp is an
		amoral perv but he was the only person I could tell about
		this.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if I <em>could</em> tell someone else I
		mean...who&rsquo;s going to believe it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp was my only
		choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least that&rsquo;s what I thought.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I thought: Parp knows what kinky freaks women
		are behind that fake straightness.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll call him
		up.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll connect.</div>
	<div class='body'>It bugged me knowing I automatically thought of
		turning to Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a reflex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like reaching
		for Daddy&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember way back at the beginning
		when I told how Jessica couldn&rsquo;t believe I was still turning to
		Parp, still confiding in him?&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought of her right then
		and I thought about how I always reached out to Parp because there was
		a part of me that was an amoral perv too and I just naturally expected
		him to have my back.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was in the doorway to my apartment building.
		One of my neighbors &mdash; Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Liang, who&rsquo;s really
		short but has these fantastic tits &mdash; had to get by me to get
		into the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;We did some cordial giggling and then
		when I was alone again I leaned against the brick entryway opposite
		the black-and-white tenant directory in the metal frame with the
		buzzer buttons.</div>
	<div class='body'>I sniffed the air.</div>
	<div class='body'>Eighty-Fifth Street in that warm early spring
		smelled like fried chicken and falafel and...corned beef I
		guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the smorgasbord that is my
		neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper West Side smorgasbord.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I
		don&rsquo;t mean just the food.&nbsp;&nbsp;People, too. People mostly
		with cash in the bank and those little signs on their doors saying
		their apartments are protected by alarms and cameras and electric
		death.</div>
	<div class='body'>And strollers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Women of all races
		pushing little white kids around in strollers while Mommy goes to the
		gym and does the four-hundred lunges.</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s my Upper West Side.</div>
	<div class='body'>I got out of the doorway and sat on the stoop
		and snapped open the cell and stamped out the cigarette on the step
		below the step I had my feet on.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was smoking a cigarette.</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp picked up and I blurted out the whole
		story. I gigcackled frequently so he would think I was telling him
		about it because it was funny in a &ldquo;what-the-fuck&rdquo; kind of
		way and so he wouldn&rsquo;t think I was scared.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I got it all out he said: &ldquo;What,
		were you scared of her?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nahhhh.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah you were.&nbsp;&nbsp;You were
		afraid because she was young, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid of what that
		dancer ass was going to do to your poor, frail vascular
		system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid she might want to get pounded a little
		harder than you can pound.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Uh, nooooooo,&rdquo; I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If I was afraid of anything it was that she
		wanted to drop a deuce on my face.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear what I just
		said?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
		I also know there&rsquo;s a million miles of broken links between
		&lsquo;I crap big like on a farm&rsquo; and &lsquo;I crap big like
		down your neck.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So why do you think she told
		me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Think that&rsquo;s just something she shares on dates
		as a kind of, &lsquo;oh-by-the-way&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like she just
		found another way to let you know she has a wide
		asshole.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;This &lsquo;big crap&rsquo; thing?
		Probably just another way of letting you know how the butt-plugs have
		transformed her ass for anal.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Then why would she say &lsquo;like on a
		farm&rsquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;You think she was saying they have a lot of
		anal sex on farms?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>There was this long pause and then he said:
		&ldquo;Jesus Christ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you think you could give me some credit for
		actually <em>being there</em>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit, if it was about a
		butt-fuck I think I would have known.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So you couldn&rsquo;t wait until the
		crap was imminent and then say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m just
		not into watching a lady load&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I knew somebody was going to ask me
		that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked myself the same question on the train-ride
		back from Cynthia&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I had an answer ready.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hey, people who want to do that to you
		aren&rsquo;t all there,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
		know the chick.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if she&rsquo;s a
		psycho?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if she drugged me, like Dahmer, and when I
		woke up I was all tied up &mdash;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;&mdash; with her asshole aimed at your
		face?!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp laughed and
		laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What if she had a cunt with teeth in
		it?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;That happens all the
		time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m always reading about some guy who went home
		with a stranger and got his dick bit off by some cunt from the <em>X-Files</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a girl who worked on
		the video!&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s into but I
		don&rsquo;t see any of those girls slipping guys mickeys so they can
		tie them up and shit their lights out.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;<em>You weren&rsquo;t there!</em> I mean, a girl&rsquo;s into
		weird shit!&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I know she&rsquo;s not into biting my
		dick off!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Teeth again!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parp
		said. &ldquo;Really.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vagina dentata.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask your
		therapist.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; I said.
		&ldquo;I have an education.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I wanted to just kick the guy in the nuts right then.&nbsp;&nbsp;He
		couldn&rsquo;t be a little sympathetic?&nbsp;&nbsp;A <em>little?</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		don&rsquo;t know her that well so I don&rsquo;t know maybe you have a
		point about her upgrading you to the premium funk.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Gee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m ninety-nine percent sure
		she wasn&rsquo;t going to tie you up and make you take a load you
		didn&rsquo;t want to take.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, the remaining one percent looked
		pretty chancy when I was standing there in her living room watching
		her rub her butt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Ya know she calls her ass a
		&lsquo;shit-cutter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;A shit-cutter.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Ominous.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I just sighed really loud and stood up and
		brushed the seat of my pants and started pacing back and forth on the
		painted, cement top of my stoop.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a really long
		pause while I tried to think of how I could tell this prick that the
		Cynthia situation wasn&rsquo;t one he could have just fucked his way
		out of if it had been him instead of me.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You know the real reason you
		bailed?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he asked, interrupting my train of thought.</div>
	<div class='body'>I sighed loud again.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You bailed because you have absolutely
		no idea why this hot young girl would want to get fucked by a chunky
		pale old geezer like you.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh, bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know why she
		was into me. It was because I told her I loved eating cunt but that
		Junior was too traditional to satisfy me with the flavor I
		crave.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Which was a big fat
		lie.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve
		crossed that bridge &mdash;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Now I get it,&rdquo; he
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It all makes sense now.&nbsp;&nbsp;You were
		afraid of getting her cunt jammed up in your face.&nbsp;&nbsp;You were
		looking for any out and then this poor chick who thinks she&rsquo;s
		got your head for the night mentions that she loads large and
		bam!&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the excuse you need to run.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I was seething.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Your therapist is going to park that
		when you pitch it to her,&rdquo; he said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I gotta go.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could
		barely get the words out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had that much rage in me right
		then.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Whoa, wait!&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got
		one more day of shooting at Vider&rsquo;s tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you
		going to be there? Cameron is.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, yeah,&rdquo; I said.
		&ldquo;Definitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;You gotta promise me not to tell Cammy
		about big-crap Cynthia though, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Come on, she&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s
		cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she&rsquo;ll get jealous.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Dude.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see a
		catfight.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I froze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cynthia&rsquo;s
		there again tomorrow?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nahhhhhh...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; he
		laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No dancers tomorrow, which I have to say
		kind of sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;And don&rsquo;t worry about your
		secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s safe with Tony.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
		relieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;See, back in those days &mdash; five months ago
		&mdash; I knew that Parp was a human turd but the legend about him was
		that he was really good at keeping secrets.</div>
	<div class='body'>Everyone said so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Even Carol
		Weiser who we called &ldquo;the Doll&rdquo; because she was this girly
		girl who looked like a Barbie doll and dressed like a sitcom mom from
		the fifties.</div>
	<div class='body'>Now, lots of people hate Parp but nobody hated
		Parp and talked shit about him like the Doll did.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess
		it kind of makes sense because she and Parp used to be great
		pals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest pals.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Doll was a
		no-dick-ever dyke so they never fucked and that pretty much was the
		kiss of death on their paldom.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		See ladies, Parp will never love you just for being <em>you</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;With
		Parp you&rsquo;re either biting his pipe or packing your bags.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So, yeah, Parp wanted to fuck the Doll and the Doll said
		no.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still liked sleeping with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
		by sleeping I do mean <em>sleeping</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I think she got away with it once and then
		halfway through their second platonic snooze Parp told her to wake up
		and fuck off.</div>
	<div class='body'>See, the Doll was hot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
		fifties-style dresses she wore?&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand they made
		her look kind of traditional.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe even like your
		mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand she wore them cut high so you could
		tell just by looking that she was inviting your mind&rsquo;s eye to
		flip the hem up on her back.</div>
	<div class='body'>It was a look that said Wally and Beav were
		asleep and June had plans for Ward.</div>
	<div class='body'>It was all just a lure for other
		dykes.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was advertising her majora and minora to ladies
		who love muff.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the side-effect was she was also
		advertising them to Parp.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Nowadays I just laugh at the asshole when I picture him lying there
		staring at the ceiling with this sweet babe snoring into his chest,
		but back then I could kind of see his point.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, when
		you&rsquo;re married to a bitch for ten years you get used to not
		touching her even when her ass is out.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a hot chick who
		flirts with you?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who strips down to her tiny panties and
		gets in your bed and then yawns and says, &ldquo;What do you think <em>you&rsquo;re</em>
		doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I&rsquo;m not saying a guy has to be a dick
		about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a decent human being you
		don&rsquo;t want women just for sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want them for, you
		know, all that other great stuff.</div>
	<div class='body'>But in case you haven&rsquo;t figured it out by
		now, Parp is not a decent human being.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was backstage with the Doll a few nights
		after the night he kicked her out.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was opening night of
		some show she was in where she played an angel who comes down from
		Heaven to help out this motorcycle chick who starts out thinking
		she&rsquo;s straight but ends up licking the angel&rsquo;s clit like
		it&rsquo;s a revelation and an epiphany and Christmas all rolled into
		one sweet set of bucking hips.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Kind of an <em>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</em> for dykes.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>So anyway me and the Doll&rsquo;s girlfriend
		Maria went backstage after.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doll was pretty drunk
		already even though she was wearing her angel outfit still.</div>
	<div class='body'>It was a little tense because Maria was already
		annoyed at seeing her girlfriend getting eaten out in public by
		somebody else, even if it was fake eating out.</div>
	<div class='body'>You know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funnilingus.</div>
	<div class='body'>The Doll started in on Parp as soon as she saw
		me.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I said to him, &lsquo;Hey, what the fuck, we&rsquo;re <em>friends!</em>&rsquo;
		and he said &lsquo;Tell it to my unsucked cock&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
		cackled.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Why were you in bed with him
		anyway?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Mariaaaaaa!&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about
		thiiiiiiiiiissssss!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a girl needs
		man-snuggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t mean she wants to kiss
		one-eyed Pete.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Fuck that guy,&rdquo; Maria said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So I said to him, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
		telling me suck your cock or get out?!&rsquo; and he says,
		&lsquo;Yep&rsquo;!&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you believe that
		shit?!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sounds like Parp,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>We went to this diner called Moonstruck in
		Chelsea and an hour later we were still at the table and she was still
		dishing on him.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s such a fucking dick then
		why were you in bed with him?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria still wanted to
		know.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You know, he really is an anal fissure
		but what you can&rsquo;t take away from him is that you can tell him
		anything and he&rsquo;ll keep it a secret if you ask him
		to.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>The Doll hesitated.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a
		mistake.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Secrets about who you <em>FUCK?!</em>&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just watched while Maria went
		up like Vesuvius &mdash; if you can picture Vesuvius pounding a
		laminate table top with chapped-knuckle dyke-fists.</div>
	<div class='body'>The guy from the register had to come over and
		ask us to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maria called him a cocksucker and we were
		out on the sidewalk fifteen seconds later.</div>
	<div class='body'>The reason I&rsquo;m telling you that story is
		so you&rsquo;ll know why I trusted Parp with all my
		secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was part of his rep even with people who hated
		him.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was in such a good mood when Parp said the
		dancers wouldn&rsquo;t be there and my secret was safe with him that I
		made the mistake of offering to help out again with the vans.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was pretty sure he was going to say,
		&ldquo;No we&rsquo;ve got it handled,&rdquo; but instead he said:
		&ldquo;That would be great.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the vans is filled with
		props and in that lot on Eighty-Third and Amsterdam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can
		you meet me tomorrow morning at six to drive it
		out?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah sure,&rdquo; I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See you tomorrow morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Hasta la later.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
	<div class='body'>I hung up and went upstairs and googled
		&ldquo;vagina dentata.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
