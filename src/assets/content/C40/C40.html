	<div class="chapterSubhead">I Try to Look Busy</div>
	<div class='body'>Later when I had a chance to think about it, I
		realized that what made me completely forget about picking Parp up that morning was him
		ridiculing me the night before for not knowing what &#8220;vagina
		dentata&#8221; meant.&#160; So the only thing I could think about was
		vagina dentata until I Googled it and found out it was just some old
		pagan legend about a cunt with teeth in it that I guess would bite
		your dick off if you tried to fuck it.&#160; Then after I found that
		out the wife came out of the bedroom to pout in the living room and
		shush me whenever I spoke because the boys were already in bed.</div>
	<div class='body'>But right then on the set at Vider&#8217;s I
		hadn&#8217;t had time to think it through that far so I was feeling
		pretty guilty about not picking Parp up.&#160; I winced.&#160; I
		looked around to see if I could see his face.&#160; Oh yeah.&#160;
		There it was almost right in front of me.&#160; It was kind of
		smirky.&#160; &#8212; Like he&#8217;d been expecting me to fuck up all
		along so he could tell everybody what a schmuck I was.&#160; I looked
		down at my feet.&#160; I looked up at him again.&#160; He still looked
		smirky.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&#8220;Fuck man,&#8221; I said.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;m <em>really</em>
		sorry.&#160; Were you waiting long?&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Nahhhh.&#160; Terry was there.&#160; I
		called him up last night so he could come down in case we needed a
		backup.&#160; We waited for you for about ten minutes then we just
		figured you forgot.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;So...you lined up two drivers?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Well, yeah.&#160; After you hung up the phone I
		got a little nervous because, you know, yesterday you completely
		forgot.&#160; So I called up Terry.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I was starting to get steamed again.&#160;
		&#8220;So what was all this clapping and humiliating me about if
		everything was okay?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Well...it&#8217;s kinda funny,
		don&#8217;t ya think?&#160; I mean two days in a row you promise to
		pick up production equipment and then completely forget?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I just seethed.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he said.&#160;
		&#8220;Lighten up.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Right then Whispers shouted: &#8220;Hey Tony,
		got a minute?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp went over to him and I stood there staring
		at an empty column of air.&#160; The prick knew I was trying to
		impress Cammy.&#160; He could have kept my little faux pas to himself
		but he made sure I was the object of community ridicule and he made
		sure Cammy took part in it.</div>
	<div class='body'>I wanted to strangle the nine-toed turd.</div>
	<div class='body'>But I was trapped.&#160; I mean, what would
		Cammy think if I tore Parp a new butt-hole right there in front of
		everybody?&#160; I just had to stand there and take it while he got
		his little public revenge.</div>
	<div class='body'>And it turned out to be a good thing that I
		kept my mouth shut. By being the wound-up back-stabber that he is,
		Parp managed to get me sympathy with babes.&#160; Especially the
		Camster.&#160; She walked up to me and gave me this big sad grin.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Hate to be you right now, huh?&#8221;
		she said.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&#8220;Fuh-<em>huuuuuuuuuuuuck</em>,&#8221; I said.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>She gigchuckled.&#160; &#8220;Dumbass.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>She pronounced the &#8220;b&#8221;.&#160;
		&#8212; &#8220;Dum-Bass.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.&#160; She gigchuckled some
		more.&#160; &#8220;Quiet on the set!&#8221; shouted Roz the assistant
		director.&#160; They were off to the races.</div>
	<div class='body'>So now that I was there I was kind of stuck
		about what to do next.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have many options.&#160;
		First I figured I could be the &#8220;producer&#8221; and not do
		anything but drink coffee and try to look like I was watching over my
		investment.</div>
	<div class='body'>I tried doing that for about five minutes when
		they were setting up the next scene and it didn&#8217;t work
		out.&#160; First off, nobody seemed to get it that I was a producer or
		that I had an investment to watch over.&#160; Two young guys came by
		lugging some locker filled with heavy lighting gear like they were
		eighty year-olds with hernias and set it down right in front of me and
		sat on it.&#160; They panted.</div>
	<div class='body'>Whispers came over and said to them,
		&#8220;Yeah, maybe I should give you girls a hand here...&#8221;&#160;
		They hopped up and he grabbed one end of the locker &#8212; the heavy
		end.&#160; He pulled.&#160; It didn&#8217;t move.&#160; Then he
		laughed.&#160; Then the two guys laughed.&#160; Then I laughed.</div>
	<div class='body'>When he heard me laugh, Whispers looked over at
		me and said: &#8220;So how&#8217;s life treatin&#8217; ya,
		Paul?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Oh, pretty good.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Yeah?&#160; Ya likin&#8217; that donut
		are ya?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh yeah.&#160; I was eating a donut from the
		donut table.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was pretty glad Cammy didn&#8217;t see me getting all self-conscious
		about the donut.&#160; I jerked my head around looking for her and
		there she was, lugging her pretty ass off with the other
		grunts-for-a-day and not paying attention to me at <em>all</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		So after I scarfed down the rest of the donut I skulked around trying
		to look busy while I sorted it out.&#160; I figured I could try just
		hanging out with the masters and creators &#8212; Parp, Vider, and
		Whispers &#8212; and people would think I was busy working on the more
		creative parts of the film.&#160; I was pretty sure that my background
		as a, you know, a <em>talent </em>meant that if I volunteered creative
		input then that input would be valued by the aforesaid masters and
		creators.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Maybe that sounds like a stretch.&#160; It really wasn&#8217;t.&#160;
		Bang &#8212; Bangalore Springfield, the comedian &#8212; was getting
		away with doing exactly what I just described.&#160; I mean, you
		should have seen it.&#160; Everybody around him was busting his or her
		hump and what was Bang doing?&#160; Cracking jokes with Parp about the
		next series of takes!&#160; And Parp is asking his advice and whatnot
		and Bang comes up with an idea and...shit!&#160; I went to school with
		Parp and Vider.&#160; I knew them from <em>way</em> the hell
		back.&#160; Bang didn&#8217;t know anybody from back then.&#160; He
		was a newcomer.&#160; A hanger-on.&#160; An interloper!&#160; He
		didn&#8217;t have <em>any</em> money in the so-called film.&#160; He
		wasn&#8217;t a master.&#160; He wasn&#8217;t a creator.&#160;
		He&#8217;d simply insinuated himself into Parp&#8217;s company so he
		could look like a bigshot in front of fuckable babes.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>So I decided I&#8217;d sidle up to Parp and
		pull the same shit.&#160; But when I got close enough for him to
		notice me I could see there was no smile in his face for me.&#160; No
		smile at all.&#160; Not even in his eyes.&#160; I guess he was still
		steamed at me for yelling at him.</div>
	<div class='body'>Okay, so no sidling up to Parp.&#160; At least
		for the time being.&#160; That left Whispers and Vider.&#160;
		Actually, that left Vider.&#160; I figured if Parp was still miffed at
		me then Whispers might still be holding against me the whole
		standing-there-eating-a-donut-while-other-people-worked thing.</div>
	<div class='body'>So Vider it was.&#160; He was standing over at
		the piano with a Starbucks cup in one hand watching other people
		work.&#160; He was my bud.&#160; From college.&#160; We were even
		dressed a little alike.&#160; We both had on the same white canvas
		sneakers and jeans.&#160; He was also wearing a gray sweater with
		silver buttons that looked like castle doorknobs and a big
		sportsjacket to help hide his big fat gut.</div>
	<div class='body'>He saw me coming.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Hey, Paul.&#160; What&#8217;s
		new?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Oh, you know.&#160; This film I
		guess.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Oh yeah?&#160; Hey Paul, mind if I ask
		what you&#8217;re doing here?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Got some money in it.&#160; Thought
		I&#8217;d, you know...&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Seriously.&#160; What are you doing
		here?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Thought...thought I&#8217;d come down to
		help.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not helping.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gave him my look-who&#8217;s-talking look and
		then quickly tried to hide it.&#160; He noticed anyway.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;I own the place,&#8221; he said.&#160;
		There was a pause while he just stared at the worker bees and sipped
		his coffee.&#160; Then right when I was thinking I better go stand
		somewhere else, he said:&#160; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you see if you
		can help someone who&#8217;s trying to get something done. &#8212;
		Like that kid over there who doesn&#8217;t know how to roll
		cable.&#160; You do that, and I&#8217;ll ask Bobby if he can use you
		in the next shot.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Wow</em> , I thought.&#160; <em>Use me in the next shot</em>.<em></em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Good deal,&#8221; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>Vider grinned and sipped his coffee.</div>
</div>
