        The Beginning
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The story begins almost five months ago, in March.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s when I met up with future wife-baller Tony Parp to talk about this project he was working on.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I&rsquo;ve known Parp for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to college together.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were supposed to be buddies.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        We met up at&nbsp;&nbsp;a Starbucks, the one on Ninety-Third and Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a medium something.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the day after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and they still had some of the green coffee left.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        We talked some shit for awhile and then he said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to shoot this music video around a jazz tune called <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>. &ndash; Sinatra would have done this song if he&rsquo;d lived and had the stones.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Huh &ndash; haaaaaaa ...&rdquo; I gave him my obligatory ho-ho-ain&rsquo;t-that-funny laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, because it wasn&rsquo;t funny, just tasteless.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;No, seriously,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Uh-huh.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the song is <em>Little Brown Jewish Hat</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Round, not brown.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Why is that so strange?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well for one thing,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it seems to lack taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean for Sinatra or for that generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinatra&rsquo;s generation.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He gave me this grin that looked extra stupid because he was wearing round purple shades.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozzie Osbourne shades, although personally I think they made him look like the chick on the poster for <em>Almost Famous</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, the head groupie.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know what I mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It sounds a little off.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Like ... it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it has enough mass appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, a jazz tune about a yarmulke.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re making fun of it, too, by calling it a little round Jewish hat.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He sipped his coffee and looked around.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a barista there with a nice rack who called him &ldquo;Mr. Tony&rdquo; and stroked his hand when she gave him change.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were staring at each other while I was trying to be analytical.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I waited for him to pay attention to me again.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sounds a litte off,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sounds vaguely anti-Semitic,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah ... Seems hard to believe that ... you know, Sinatra ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Parp laughed,&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like he actually recorded it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Okay, look.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know by now you&rsquo;ve probably all seen <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        on the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s &ldquo;viral.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even complained about it on Fox one night and MSNBC too, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those strippers wearing the yarmulkes?&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the kids think it&rsquo;s funny but ... you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Taste, anyone?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But back then when he was telling me about it all I knew was the title.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said &ldquo;Sinatra.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know it was supposed to be funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; I&rsquo;m pretty sure he was leading me on just so I&rsquo;d feel like an asshole later.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Does it have a tune?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It's a song,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Songs have tunes.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Even though I couldn&rsquo;t see his eyes too well I figured out he was looking over my shoulder at this guy with a white curly wire leading from his ear to a square thing in his chest pocket and having a conversation way too loud.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like it was his office and his secretary was right outside and he was trying to impress her with his alpha bossness.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Haaaaaa ... haaaaaaa ... haaaaaaa&rdquo; it was a laugh that brayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;A donkey laugh.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Jules,&rdquo; the fatboy was saying, &ldquo;you tell Erica I want her tushy down at that audition at ten-fifteen sharp.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you listen to the fat fuck?&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder who the show is for.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You never know,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Something young and fit with no bush and a tat walks in, thinks he&rsquo;s an agent, good for ... two blowjobs before she finds out he does the PHP for the MTA&nbsp;&nbsp;website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; You see how he&rsquo;s watching the door?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Porky fuck,&rdquo; Parp said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Spend some time in the gym, chimptwat.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp hated porky fucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was a little awkward, because I was kind of on the paunchy side myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the wrong angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;In bright light.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This is Parp:&nbsp;&nbsp;long hair, dyed an unnatural black.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanned face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leathery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amateur body builder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always wears compression-fit t-shirts, even in the Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeans, sneakers, the aforementioned round shades.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a collection of these same-style shades in an assortment of colors.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        A complete asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        As will be demonstrated in this tale of vengeance.&nbsp;&nbsp;And justice.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I'll send the song to your email address,&rdquo; he said. Oh yeah. <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bobby&rsquo;s shooting it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Bobby Whispers owns a tobacco store on Sixth Avenue, but he had been a comedy writer for a long time and now he directed and produced indy flicks.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s also married to Mondi McDade.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        No shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Married to a fucking rock star for fifteen years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s worth it to hang around him just to see if she&rsquo;ll show up and make eye contact with me.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But if you&rsquo;ve been alive and on the Internet in the last three months you already know all about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispers has some issues too, that I won&rsquo;t go into.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not out for revenge on him, necessarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t like he&rsquo;s blowing his load down my wife&rsquo;s throat every night.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        For a second it was quiet, except for the &ldquo;agent&rdquo; on his cell, then Parp asked:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you want to be in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;The video?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Fuck yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Babes on the set?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;A bevy,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So who would I play?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Okay, the video is about a guy who loses his yarmulke on a windy day. A girl finds it and she gives it to him and wow, he looks like a model, you know?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing that guy, am I?&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Fuck no,&rdquo; he said, the asshole.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have Lenny Paine lined up for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know Lenny Paine?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings down at Vider&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get down to Vider&rsquo;s much.&nbsp;&nbsp;So who do I play?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I see&nbsp;&nbsp;you as a passerby who does one of those great doubletakes you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe two.&nbsp;&nbsp;One closeup.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Um ... compensation?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a SAG micro-budget deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;You get a hundred bucks for the day plus carfare to and from.&nbsp;&nbsp;And lunch.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
