        While Mommy's on Vacation
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It&rsquo;s hot in this apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t
        know how they used to do this book-writing shit back in the
        typewriter days.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we all got out of college and moved to
        Manhattan I remember Parp and Vider typing up their little comedy
        sketches all the time on one of those click-pound-whiteout machines
        and never complaining about the damned ribbon or the paper
        crinkling up or any of it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Libby used to live with them in those days, when
        he was going out every night to clubs and parties and he said
        he&rsquo;d get home at like six in the morning and there&rsquo;d be
        Parp or Vider or both typing up and talking about and laughing at and
        sometimes fighting over their little comedy skits which got them
        exactly nowhere.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Well, Vider went somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of.&nbsp;&nbsp;He did 
        stand-up with Parp and Bobby Whispers writing for him and he got 
        all the way to <em>Letterman</em>
        one night where he just froze up
        in front of the microphone.&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t remember it because
        they cut it out of the broadcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was it for Vider&rsquo;s
        career.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He had stage fright for a couple years after
        that.&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd be fine until you showed him a flat riser with a microphone on it.
		Then suddenly he was Curly in a haunted house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows why? I guess maybe his
        shrink knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something dark and scary, a lobe-roach nesting in
        gray brain crinkles.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So he took all the money he had and bought a
        little comedy club and called it &ldquo;Vider&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And
        it got famous and then later he made it a regular nightclub with
        bands and singers in addition to the comics.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I guess Parp was always kind of behind the
        scenes, like Whispers was, only Parp didn&rsquo;t meet, fuck, and
        marry a damn bona fide rock star the way Whispers did.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp and Whispers always
        had day jobs, the losers, which gives them some balls for looking
        down on me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Am I right?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It&rsquo;s <em>hot.</em>
        A little while ago I had
        to cook up some ribs for the kids because it&rsquo;s BBQ Ribs
        &lsquo;n Lucky Charms Night here at Casa Man Squad.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Etiquette says that
        when the mommy goes off to lollipop the head of someone
        else&rsquo;s cock for a month, the daddy can pretty much say to
        fuck with all of her little rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I can&rsquo;t be too
        bitter about it in front of Sam and Harry since they think
        Mommy&rsquo;s off on a vacation.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;And while Mommy&rsquo;s on vacation from
        us, we&rsquo;re going to take a vacation from Mommy,&rdquo; I told
        them.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I&rsquo;m pretty sure they said yay.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So they get to eat pretty much anything they
        like and watch anything they like and stay up as late as they like
        or until Daddy needs to get some grown-up sanity back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually they
        get tired around nine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten at the latest.&nbsp;&nbsp;So that isn&rsquo;t a
        problem.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then Daddy can download porn and chat with online
        cunt.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So thanks for the free time, ya damn slut.
