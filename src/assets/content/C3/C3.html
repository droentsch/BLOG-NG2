        Shit Happens
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        My wife's name is Corrinne.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was named after an African-American lady her mother says she &ldquo;took in.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        In reality, the original Corrinne &ndash; Corrinne Senior &ndash; was renting the room over Corrinne Junior&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;So when my mother-in-law says she took her in she&rsquo;s just being a big fat lying racist if you ask me.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And if that isn't bad enough, my mother-in-law also smells like socks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ask my kids when she visits.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Plus, she is the obese person&rsquo;s idea of a lardass.&nbsp;&nbsp; A monstrosity of steaming guts, with little breakfast sausages for arms and legs.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s one of those people you see walking down the subway stairs at rush hour taking each step on a ten-count, oblivious to the fact that she is being assassinated in the imaginations of everyone blocked by her gigantic ass from reaching the train.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Anyway, Corrinne Senior &ndash; the black lady &ndash; and Racquel &ndash; my mother-in-law &ndash; became really tight friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did everything together.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Racquel had looked slightly more human they may have even licked each other up and down every day.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So what I&rsquo;m saying is: they were tight.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then they had a falling out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, whenever Racquel visits, smelling like socks and pissing off commuters, she relives the break-up in the same whining detail, ending with:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And I named you after her.&nbsp;&nbsp;My only daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she knew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she went right ahead and blew your father anyway.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Right, she's divorced, and Corrinne's dad is I guess still pounding the exquisite cunt of Corrinne Senior, who I met a couple times and who has a really thin waist and wide hips that have never borne children.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I think about her sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most black chicks, she has a mouth made for pipe.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So like I said, Corrinne Senior has a tight little waist and thin little hands and a really cute face.&nbsp;&nbsp;And a big ass and rack.&nbsp;&nbsp;I first met her at our wedding, where her infamous husband, my wife's dad, was sitting in the corner with his feet up on a divan, rolling an unlit cigar in his mouth, and riffing with his pals on the factoid that &ldquo;guano&rdquo; means bat shit.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Fuck, and she probably calls the retard &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; while he puts his tongue up her asshole. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        (That&nbsp;&nbsp;happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole daddy/tongue/asshole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more on that in about a jillion chapters.)
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Shit happens like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;One day you&rsquo;re married to a greasy meatball and you have no hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great day is when you don&rsquo;t cut yourself shaving and you get a big smile from a chick attractive enough for you to think about later when you beat off.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then one day, a day like any other, you find out the greasy meatball&rsquo;s hot friend thinks your cock is a Happy Meal.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And you realize that the world has colors, beaches, and sunshine, and you don&rsquo;t need the fat lady after all.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It kind of happened to me once.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or almost.&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived on this block where this woman passed me everyday on the street like she had no idea who I was. Sometimes she even looked away and grimaced, like I was some toad-thing.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then one day, one fourth of July, I was walking down this same street and she came out to meet me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran.&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually ran to catch me.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was all smiles and wavering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunked up, as my uncle used to say.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She just stood there for a second then she said: &ldquo;I wanna fucken fuck you.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I just know for sure I would have fucked her too only she slurred her words so badly that I had to ask her to repeat herself twice before I knew what she was saying.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And by then she was annoyed.
    </div>
