	<div class="chapterSubhead">A Tobacco That Tastes Like a Lady</div>
	<div class='body'>It turned out that
		Roz-the-assistant-director&rsquo;s dayjob was working up at
		Whispers&rsquo;s tobacco shop with a bunch of other chicks who I think
		were all somewhere on the proclivity continuum between bisexual and
		dyke.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;If Paul&rsquo;s wife is so tasty,&rdquo;&nbsp;Roz said to
		Whispers, &ldquo;then maybe you should name the tobacco after <em>her</em>.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Lenny: &ldquo;Tobacco?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Vider: &ldquo;You had to ask.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Lenny: &ldquo;Well, sure I did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Roz
		made a statement intended to evince the question
		&lsquo;tobacco?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what tobacco?&rsquo; &mdash;
		Isn&rsquo;t that right, Roz?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Roz: &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Lenny: &ldquo;So what is it?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Roz: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tobacco that tastes
		like snatch.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She grinned this really wide grin like she was
		Pandora announcing her box was now open.</div>
	<div class='body'>Everybody laughed because of course they
		thought it was a joke.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;No shit,&rdquo;&nbsp;she
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Exactly like snatch.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You gotta be blowin&rsquo; kidding
		me!&rdquo; Bang said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have some?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Not on me,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Whispers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly he looked a little shy.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What I want to know,&rdquo;&nbsp;Vider
		said, &ldquo;is how did you get tobacco to taste like
		vagina?&nbsp;&nbsp;And it better not be the way I think.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;All I did was mix up a new blend of
		tobacco from some of my favorite leaves mixed in with a new leaf that
		comes in a tin marked &lsquo;Ciao Bella&rsquo;.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;And this new mixture tastes like
		pink?&rdquo; asked one of the dancing strippers.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I thought it was my imagination when I
		first lit up,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bobby said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But I gave
		some to Mondi and she said yup, tastes like a lady.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shitting me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Mondi McDade said &lsquo;a lady&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I bet she said
		&lsquo;cunt&rsquo;,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Roz.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It sure tastes like
		cunt,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Vider.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That is some of the
		cuntingest tobacco I&rsquo;ve ever tasted.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Suddenly everyone in the room, male and female,
		had to have some.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a couple of the ladies begged off
		and let&rsquo;s face it I don&rsquo;t smoke a pipe but if I did...I
		dunno...Cunt?</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t into that
		shit,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Mallory.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So are you going to start selling this
		tobacco in the store?&rdquo; Lenny asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yup.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the girls up there
		think it would be a good idea to market it on the
		Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, starting with Twitter and
		Facebook.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So what are you calling it?&rdquo; I
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Good question,&rdquo;&nbsp;he
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some candidates.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He hates my name, what I want to call
		it,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Roz.</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp: &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Roz: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell if Bobby lets
		me.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Whispers just hung his head and shook it, like
		how is he going to stop the inevitable?</div>
	<div class='body'>Roz: &ldquo;I wanna calllll
		ittttttt...Camel-toe-bacco.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Big smile.</div>
	<div class='body'>Some giggles from the gang.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
		it,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Mallory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she belly-laughed.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, that sucks,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Lenny.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;There is no way it goes out with
		&lsquo;Camel-toe-bacco&rsquo; on the label,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bobby said
		evenly.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with just plain old
		Cuntbacco?&rdquo; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cuntbacco.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Git me a chaw of
		that Cuntbacker, Coach, and I&rsquo;ll pitch me up another three
		innin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mallory said, more to me
		than to Bang, like I might be able to translate for her.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I do kind of have a name for
		it,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bobby said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of
		calling it &lsquo;One for the Road.&rsquo;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Silence.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bang
		said.</div>
	<div class='body'>Mallory touched my arm.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I like your name better,&rdquo;&nbsp;she
		said kind of low.</div>
	<div class='body'>The other dancing stripper, the one who said
		she was impressed by me a minute or so before?&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked
		at me right then and started to walk over to where I was
		sittiing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cleared a spot for her on the chair next to me
		by pushing some coats on the floor.</div>
	<div class='body'>The girl &mdash; Cynthia &mdash; put her pretty
		ass in the chair and just sort of sat there in her tiny pink lycra
		hotpants.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then she giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
		gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp; My cock lurched.</div>
	<div class='body'>By the time I was able to tune back in they
		were onto the subject of how &ldquo;One for the Road&rdquo; &mdash;
		the tobacco that tastes like cunt &mdash; raised the inevitable
		question of whether or not it&rsquo;s possible to eat cunt while the
		owner of said cunt is driving an automobile.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;How is that the inevitable
		question?&rdquo; Vider asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought together the taste
		of cunt and the image of roadway travel,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think that most people are going to wonder
		how you&rsquo;ll enjoy that taste in a car.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;By lightin&rsquo; up the
		tobacco,&rdquo;&nbsp;Roz said.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it raises that image at
		all,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think it conjures the
		importance of that one last taste of cunt <em>before</em> you hit the
		road.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo;&nbsp;Vider
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If you ask a bartender for &lsquo;one more for
		the road&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to drink it in
		your car.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Good point,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bang
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless,
		we&rsquo;re all just hangin&rsquo; here and so I&rsquo;m asking: how
		would you, if it&rsquo;s even possible, eat out a woman while
		she&rsquo;s driving a car?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be that
		hard,&rdquo;&nbsp;I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could get her to
		scooch down in the seat, then you bend over and perform a facial
		probe.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Cynthia.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		Mallory kind of looked at Cynthia then got up and walked
		away.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>New girl wins!</em> I thought.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re assuming her pants are
		off at the start of the drive?&rdquo; asked Vider.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sounds a little risky,&rdquo;&nbsp;Lenny
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;d have to have her pants off for the
		full ride.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo;&nbsp;I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s wearing a short skirt and
		no underpants.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So they have to be planning this from
		the beginning of the trip.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be spontaneous
		then.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo;&nbsp;I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say the underpants are
		on.&nbsp;&nbsp; She could get the urge, pull over, take them off, get
		back in the car, come, pull over, and put them back on.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo;&nbsp;Parp
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That reeks goofy.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo;&nbsp;Cynthia laughed.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s pulling over to take her
		pants off so you can eat her, why don&rsquo;t you just stay pulled
		over and eat her on the back seat?&rdquo; Parp asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Maybe, I dunno, she likes the
		danger?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Then, because I&rsquo;m playing
		cunt-licker&rsquo;s advocate, the conversation gets around to
		Junior&rsquo;s cunt.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Ever do that with Junior?&rdquo; Parp
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I love that you call your wife
		Junior,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bang said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What, is her mother
		named Corrinne too?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She was named after her mother&rsquo;s close
		friend who was such a good fellatrix that a year after Junior was born
		her father dumped her mother to marry Corrinne Senior.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; asked Bang.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Bang didn&rsquo;t hear anything after
		&lsquo;fellatrix&rsquo;,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Vider.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a fellatrix?&rdquo; someone
		asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;A dick-sucker,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Roz with
		a big grin on her face.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Cynthia asked me.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it
		means,&rdquo;&nbsp;I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;&nbsp;she
		laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She must really know how to suck on a
		dick.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the legend.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So have you ever eaten your wife on the
		road?&rdquo; Vider asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo;&nbsp;I
		said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not that I have anything against it but, you
		know, Junior&rsquo;s a traditional gal.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Cynthia laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I began to
		notice that her laugh was something of a gigcackle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		looked at her and grinned.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t <em>look</em> traditional,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Bobby.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;She looks tasty,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Parp.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Ya know,&rdquo;&nbsp;I said, &ldquo;a
		guy could get pretty defensive about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, if we
		were marines we&rsquo;d be fistfighting right now.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Marines are a lot more open-minded about sex
		than you think.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>He was dead serious.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then they started talking about marines and I
		started thinking about a way to get out of there with Cynthia.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Gotta be moseying,&rdquo;&nbsp;I said to
		her kind of low.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody heard but her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
		stretched back then leaned forward with deliberation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out
		of the corner of my eye I could see she was moving to get her stuff
		together.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fuck was on.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Leavin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Parp asked when I
		stood up.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Gotta mosey on home and see the
		boys,&rdquo;&nbsp;I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;And your tasty wife,&rdquo;&nbsp;said
		Bang.</div>
	<div class='body'>I looked at Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See what
		you started?&rdquo; I turned for the door, which was behind me and
		through a vestibule.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		On my way out I could hear the conversation make a turn for the
		stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did Oscar Wilde write <em>Kind Hearts
			and Coronets</em>?&rdquo; Bang asked.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oscar Wilde died in
		nineteen-hundred,&rdquo;&nbsp;Vider said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He
		pre-dates the cinema.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pretty young though when he
		died.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was forty-six.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So if he&rsquo;d lived to say, age
		seventy he could have written silent film scenarios,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bang
		said.</div>
	<div class='body'>Whispers guffawed and clapped his hands
		slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a hell and Oscar Wilde is
		in it I&rsquo;m sure they have him writing silent
		films,&rdquo;&nbsp;he said.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then a voice I didn&rsquo;t recognize said:
		&ldquo;There is nothing so spoken as the vulgar word.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
