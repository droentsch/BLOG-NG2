	<div class="chapterSubhead">Bitch For a Day</div>
	<div class='body'>I was feeling pretty damn low driving out to
		Hempstead to pick up Belinda, Parp&rsquo;s on-set cunt. &nbsp;&nbsp;In
		case you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention, Parp tricked me into
		being his bitch for a day so now I had to drive out to pick up the
		cunt so she&rsquo;d be available later when he needed to stick his
		tongue up a big butt.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And I do mean <em>big. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em> Maybe you know the type.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin waist, giant ass. &nbsp;&nbsp;How do they do
		that?&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they&rsquo;re wearing corsets twenty-four hours
		a day.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I was picturing Parp explaining to her apple ass how in Parp World sex
		has to last for a couple hours or it&rsquo;s not worth having.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;I was picturing her listening to him with this big grin on
		her face because she&rsquo;s thinking about all the orgasms
		she&rsquo;s in for. &nbsp;&nbsp;Then in my mind I cut to an hour later
		and pictured her with her face in a pillow and her ass in the air just
		wishing it would <em>end</em>, for Christ&rsquo;s sake.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>
		I had to laugh at that, but as I plunged into the bowels of Queens I
		was back to kicking myself. &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I get into this
		fix?&nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked and the next thing I knew I was promising to
		give Parp my wages from yesterday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;And <em>now</em>
		I was driving crew around like a damn cabby.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>But asking myself how it happened was just
		rhetorical. &nbsp;&nbsp;You know, for the gods. &nbsp;&nbsp;I knew
		what happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was my own fault. &nbsp;&nbsp;I set
		myself up. &nbsp;&nbsp;I felt guilty for forgetting the van so I let
		Parp railroad me in exchange for forgiveness.</div>
	<div class='body'>I pounded the steering wheel I was so pissed.
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Cocksucker!</div>
	<div class='body'>I settled down a little bit after I got into
		Nassau County, even though at one point I lost my way.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it&rsquo;s no big deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;Asking for
		directions from strangers is a time-honored American tradition.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulling up alongside another car, rolling down the window,
		smiling while the other driver rolls down his, shouting, &ldquo;How do
		I get to the highway?&rdquo; &mdash; The sense of comunity derived
		thereby connects me with my fellow travellers, including my father and
		his father before him.</div>
	<div class='body'>GPS, on the other hand, connects me with jack
		shit.</div>
	<div class='body'>I found the road to Hempstead again without the
		aid of mechanical voices and just settled into the drive.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever been to Long Island?&nbsp;&nbsp;A string of little
		towns hung on semi-highways. &nbsp;&nbsp;Gas stations, malls, cheap
		little houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;The worst sight of all?&nbsp;&nbsp;The
		funeral parlors. &nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you see one it&rsquo;s like a
		big sign saying, &ldquo;Some people never get out of here.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>That shit started haunting me back in the early
		Eighties when we all first moved to the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;They
		didn&rsquo;t used to bug me &mdash; the funeral homes &mdash; until
		Vider pointed out what it meant. &nbsp;&nbsp;See, we were all living
		in these bad neighborhoods. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ghettos, where the
		supermarkets smell like rotting food and cat box and you can&rsquo;t
		wait for that part of your life to be over.</div>
	<div class='body'>We were standing on the sidewalk on a summer
		afternoon in Washington Heights with the sunlight blazing off the
		pavement and white brick and car metal. &nbsp;&nbsp; We were counting
		our change to see if we could afford to buy a couple drinks.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;We got done counting and I turned to go but Vider just
		stood there stock-still because he noticed we were standing in front
		of a funeral home.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Some people here don&rsquo;t get
		out,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Swear to God, the guy was trembling.
		&ldquo;You know when you&rsquo;re getting out?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;ASAP,&rdquo; I said and kept walking for
		the nearest bar. &nbsp;&nbsp;I just wrote the episode down to Vider
		spookiness. You know?&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of nowhere things would haunt the
		guy. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like a few years later when he froze in front of the
		microphone on Letterman. But as the years passed the thing about the
		funeral homes stayed with me and even amplified as I got older.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when I see one it&rsquo;s like it sees me back and
		says, &ldquo;Passing through?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		There are a <em>lot</em> of funeral homes on Long Island.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>So I finally got out to Hempstead to pick up
		this Belinda, who was officially the still photographer.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-rise jeans again and a black camera-bag slung over her
		shoulder. &nbsp;&nbsp;I tried not to look too hungry watching her over
		the steering wheel as she walked out to the car. &nbsp;&nbsp;But it
		was hard not to stare. &nbsp;&nbsp;She was kind of a puzzle and I was
		trying to put the pieces together: she&rsquo;s naked on the Internet,
		she&rsquo;s a photographer, she likes wearing fuck-me jeans to work.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;She had on a little red t-shirt and these big round tits
		poking domes so big they lifted the shirt off her midriff.</div>
	<div class='body'>And I&rsquo;m convinced Parp is bending her
		over.</div>
	<div class='body'>I hated the prick right then. &nbsp;&nbsp;Surfs
		the Internet, finds cunt he wants, calls it up, bends it over.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;What an egomaniac.</div>
	<div class='body'>She got in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she
		said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So, ready for day two?&rdquo; I asked
		like her uncle.</div>
	<div class='body'>Turns out she&rsquo;s shy. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinda sweet, too, but the ass and the pants and the
		ol&rsquo; Internet nudity says she was already sizing me up for my
		drill potential.</div>
	<div class='body'>I resisted the urge to say, &ldquo;Blowing
		Parp?&rdquo; and tried to make chit-chat about bullshit things
		instead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unseasonably humid, huh?&rdquo; I asked.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For March, I mean.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I smell fecundity in the air.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&ldquo;Fecundity. &nbsp;&nbsp;Fertility. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Spring!</em>&rdquo;
		she smiled.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; I said, probably a little
		distracted. &nbsp;&nbsp;All I could think about was her
		no-doubt-shaven snatch burning a hole into the upholstery of the seat
		next to me.</div>
	<div class='body'>She really didn&rsquo;t seem like an Internet
		nude poser. &nbsp;&nbsp;I made a mental note to check out her blog
		that night after the wife was in bed.</div>
	<div class='body'>About ten minutes into the drive I made her
		giggle for the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;See, the only thing we had in
		common that we knew about was Parp and the shoot so we got onto the
		subject of Parp nuttiness pretty quick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ever notice
		the missing toe on Parp&rsquo;s right foot?&rdquo; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>I was watching the road but out of the corner
		of my eye I could see her looking at me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He has
		only four toes?&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;She giggled.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yup, you just have to look.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d have to take off his
		shoe, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I said.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can see through the sneaker. &nbsp;&nbsp;Four
		little lumps, not five. &nbsp;&nbsp;You never have to take clothes off
		when you can count lumps.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>That killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed her tasty
		ass off.</div>
	<div class='body'>And that&rsquo;s how we rode: me joking, her
		giggling. &nbsp;&nbsp;Every now and then I was able to take my eye off
		the road and get a look at the belt buckle that just covered her
		mound.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		And all I could think was: <em>man, am I married.</em>
	</div>
