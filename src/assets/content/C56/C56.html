        A Leap of Faith
    </div>
    <div class="body">At first I was cheerful. &nbsp;&mdash; I was on the road to recovery! &nbsp;But a few minutes after walking to Amsterdam
        to get to my street I started mulling it over.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And mulling it over got me pretty depressed. &nbsp;First of all, I was about to start doing that Parp thing everybody
        always laughed at. &nbsp;Namely, changing my whole life so I could achieve some simple goal.
    </div>
    <div class="body">The essence of Parp nuttiness!
    </div>
    <div class="body">It was maybe five minutes after Parp left me &mdash; <em>only</em> &nbsp;five minutes &mdash; before I&rsquo;d convinced
        myself I could probably achieve the same simple goal just by eating more broccoli or drinking ten cups of water a
        day or something. &nbsp;Some simple routine I could find out on some website somewhere if only I knew the right words
        to google with. &nbsp;Some secret that was real easy but dark and killer like, &ldquo;Eat three stalks of celery
        with peanut butter and whey protein. &nbsp;Watch your cock bulge while the pounds melt away!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">But here I was, about to remake my triceps in Parp&rsquo;s image.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Who was I?
    </div>
    <div class="body">Seriously. &nbsp;Did I even like myself? &nbsp;
    </div>
    <div class="body">It was pretty cool that evening out on the street so when I noticed I was sweating it jarred me a little. &nbsp;It was
        like I had a fever. &nbsp;Like I&rsquo;d sold my soul to the Evil One, maybe. &nbsp;Or like I was Walter Neff in
        <em>Double Indemnity</em>, unable to hear my own footsteps on the sidewalk because I was already a dead man. &nbsp;Or
        maybe both.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Swear to any god you might think I believe in: at one point I was sure I could feel Parp&rsquo;s breath on my neck.
    </div>
    <div class="body">It was clammy.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I was taking a leap of faith! &nbsp;And not just any old leap of faith,
        <em>but a leap of faith I couldn&rsquo;t tell anyone about</em>.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Maybe you&rsquo;re out there right now taking a night course so you can keep your job or get a better one or surprise
        your wife with your newfound ability to &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know &mdash; build a cabinet or fix a toilet or cook
        up some of those delicious sauces you know she loves. &nbsp;Sauces with basil and tomato paste that simmer while
        she drools. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s manly. &nbsp;Civilized. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s
        <em>something you can tell other people about.</em> &nbsp;But &ldquo;training&rdquo; my cock? &nbsp;I can call it
        whatever I want but if anybody catches me in the act then all I am is a pervert.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Worse. &nbsp;A <em>lonely</em>&nbsp;pervert.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And where&rsquo;s the guarantee I was going to actually end up a new man? &nbsp;An enviable man. &nbsp;Full of fuck energy
        and hard as a rock.
    </div>
    <div class="body">Okay. I believed in the prescription magic. &nbsp;Pound down a few of those pills and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve got either
        a hardon or a piece of a class-action suit against a pharmaceutical company.
    </div>
    <div class="body">But all the working out and vitamins and eating those powdered superfoods that Parp eats? &nbsp;Like I said: &nbsp;
        <em>where was the guarantee?</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">I was pretty sure I couldn&rsquo;t sue Parp if his theories and schemes and experiments turned out to be horseshit. &nbsp;And
        if I
        <em>did</em>&nbsp;sue him, what did I stand to win? &nbsp;A Surface Pro? &nbsp;A paperback copy of the
        <em>Federalist Papers</em>? &nbsp;Dumbbells?
    </div>
    <div class="body">So you can see where my brain was going. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t want to imitate Parp, because he is the incarnation of
        all that is evil. &nbsp;The anti-Christ. &nbsp;The destroyer of worlds. &nbsp;Rosemary&rsquo;s baby. &nbsp;But imitating
        him looked like my safest bet if I wanted to be boss cock at my next bonefest.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I walked into my apartment thinking these thoughts. &nbsp;Thoughts that forced me to sit on my sofa holding my keys and
        forgetting what time it was and where the boys and Junior were and when they might be back.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And the train of thought that had me sitting there like a statue &mdash; sitting there
        <em>transfixed</em>&nbsp;&mdash; was the thought of all the people I would eventually have to explain this to and
        how behind my back they would laugh and shake their heads and riff on my pathetic existence. &nbsp;People like Kurt
        Libby and Jonno and the Doll.
    </div>
    <div class="body">What was I going to tell them? &nbsp;I guess I could make it sound like I wasn&rsquo;t changing my
        <em>whole</em>&nbsp;life. &nbsp;I could make it sound like I was adapting Parp for the sane mind. &nbsp;(&ldquo;Diet
        and exercise, you guys! &nbsp;You should try it!&rdquo;) &nbsp;But they&rsquo;d be able to tell I&rsquo;d gone over.
        &nbsp;That I&rsquo;d traded my independent life for Parp nuttiness. &mdash; Which was now
        <em>my</em>&nbsp;nuttiness.
    </div>
    <div class="body">When I roused myself out of the stupor induced by these thoughts and moved off the sofa, it was to do something truly
        insane. &nbsp;Namely, send an email to Cammy.
    </div>
    <div class="body">But I had a good reason. &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;Even in hindsight I can&rsquo;t argue with the reasoning. &nbsp;See, I knew
        that giving my soul to Satan was something I could pretty much back-burner if there was no second date with the Camster.
        &nbsp;So I figured: &nbsp;send her an email and feel her out.
    </div>
    <div class="body">I mean, she did say, &ldquo;the next time we do it,&rdquo; the last time we did it, so I guess her mood at the time was
        yeah. &nbsp;Second date. &nbsp;Why not?
    </div>
    <div class="body">But now? &nbsp;Now there was this part of me that wondered what she meant by &ldquo;it.&rdquo; &nbsp;At first I thought
        I was just being paranoid. &nbsp;But then I thought: &nbsp;
        <em>Jesus, I don&rsquo;t know what she means by &ldquo;it&rdquo; or just about anything else.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">I mean, who was she, anyway? &nbsp;She gets off pretending to be a little boy
        <em>and</em>&nbsp;his mother. &nbsp;She splits like a hooker after telling me I have a limp dick. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s
        an actress. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s an artistic director.
    </div>
    <div class="body">And she&rsquo;s in her mid-thirties!
    </div>
    <div class="body"><em>Shit</em>, I thought. &nbsp;
        <em>I haven&rsquo;t got a clue what she means or wants or thinks or knows.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">So on the one hand: if Cammy was up for a second date? &nbsp;My soul went straight to the Dark Lord. &nbsp;On the other
        hand, if she said, &ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; then I could eat pizza and watch TV and pretty much keep my soul to myself
        &mdash; except for the part of my soul that regularly went to the fam.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And of course Lord of All Tail would have to struggle with rejection. &nbsp;But struggling with rejection was a me I knew.
        &nbsp;A me I was pals with. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s why I have Jessica.
