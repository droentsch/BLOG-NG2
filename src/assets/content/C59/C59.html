    <div class="chapterSubhead">The Parp Proclivities</div>
    <div class="body">
        Jessica wasn&rsquo;t the only person in my life who wondered why Parp was helping me out. &nbsp;Kurt Libby was at least as
        curious as Jessica and way more dramatic.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And he was kind of a dick about it too.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Let me get this what they call &lsquo;straight&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said like he was rehearsing to play the district
        attorney. &nbsp;&ldquo;You take out your dick. &nbsp;The dick you own. &nbsp;And you use it to plow this Cammy &mdash;
        a chick you risked your marriage to nail. &nbsp;Then Parp takes out his wallet and covers the room for you and you
        don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s expecting anything in exchange.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t pay for the room, Kurt. &nbsp;I gave him the cash and he let me use his gold card. &nbsp;Plus he alibi&rsquo;d
        me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So your wife actually asked him where you were and he lied for you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Not yet. &nbsp;But if she does he&rsquo;ll alibi me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So he
        <em>said</em>
        &nbsp; he&rsquo;ll alibi you but he never actually provided the service. &nbsp;And if he does, you&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s
        just being your old chum. &nbsp;Nothing in it for him. &nbsp;Just good ol&rsquo; altruistic Parp.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll alibi me. &nbsp;Yeah sure Parp&rsquo;s kind of a preposterous character and occasional
        schmuck but I have to say he&rsquo;s usually pretty good about keeping his promises, and without demanding anything
        in return. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a matter of principle with him. &nbsp;Just ask the Doll.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know. &nbsp;Carol. &nbsp;Carol Weiser.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I thought she hated Parp.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;She does. &nbsp;But she still vouches for him when it comes to keeping promises&hellip; &nbsp;Well, secrets. &nbsp;Keeping
        secrets. &nbsp;If Parp promises to keep a secret for you he always does.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But the whole time I was saying this I was remembering how on alibi morning Parp didn&rsquo;t pick up his phone when I called
        him from the Starbucks at World Wide Plaza. &nbsp;I mean, I really wanted to believe he took seriously this whole
        giving-me-an-alibi business. &nbsp;And maybe he would have picked up if he&rsquo;d seen Junior&rsquo;s name on the
        caller ID. &nbsp;But&hellip; I had this gut feeling he&rsquo;d just slept through the phone ringing. &nbsp;And if
        he
        <em>had</em>
        &nbsp;slept through the phone ringing? &nbsp;When he and I were supposed to be wide awake and sweating over the post-production
        of <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>? &nbsp;And if it
        <em>had</em>
        &nbsp;been Junior calling instead of me?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Disaster. &nbsp;Well, potential disaster. &nbsp;Yeah. &nbsp;Potential.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying he handed you a plastic card,&rdquo; Libby said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t cost him anything.
        &nbsp;Now you owe him a favor. &nbsp;Now you&rsquo;re into him.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well, handing me the card wasn&rsquo;t nothing. &nbsp; I got a great room for cheap because of this &lsquo;gold club&rsquo;
        he belongs to.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t cost
        <em>him</em>
        &nbsp; anything,&rdquo; Libby said. &nbsp;&ldquo;See what I mean? &nbsp;He&rsquo;s got this card lying around. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s
        not like he was planning to use it himself but he let you have it instead. &nbsp;It cost him
        <em>zero</em>
        , and now you owe him.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Yeah, Libby really hated Parp.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And look: I knew it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to be on my guard against Parp, but I really wasn&rsquo;t worried he might have some
        hidden motive that I hadn&rsquo;t already thought about and sweated over. &nbsp;Remember when I met Parp at the City
        Diner that night a few days before the Inaugural Ball? &nbsp;So I could confront him about why he was helping me?
        &nbsp;Well, back then I was pretty suspicious and even a little peeved and his explanation still satisfied me. &nbsp;Why
        should I start worrying about it now?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Besides, I figured I had a superior knowledge of the Parp Proclivities. &nbsp;Proclivities that rose like steam from the
        canals twisting through his cerebellum. &nbsp;Proclivities known collectively and to the layman as
        <em>Parp nuttiness</em>
        .
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Like I said once before, I&rsquo;ve known Parp since before there was an MTV. &nbsp;He loved the thought of kicking the props
        out from under some institution we all bought into just because our parents did. &nbsp;It warmed him up like a red-state
        Christmas.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I knew that for a fact.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Back last March &mdash; or maybe it was early April already &mdash; when Libby and I were having our conversation we were
        in the lounge of the Commodore Hotel where he works as a bartender. &nbsp;This lounge? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s designed
        and managed by the same company that designed and manages the Irish Tavern &mdash; where I work &mdash; and they
        look a lot alike except when you step out of the bar at the Tavern you&rsquo;re stepping onto the Fiftieth Street
        sidewalk. &nbsp;But when you step out of the lounge at the Commodore? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re stepping on a carpet in
        a hallway that leads to other parts of the hotel.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ya know what it exactly &mdash; and I mean
        <em>exactly</em>
        &nbsp;&mdash; reminds me of?&rdquo; Libby asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Let me guess. &nbsp;It reminds you of the time Parp let you bang Desiree Skarsgaard in his apartment for six months.&rdquo;

    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Holy shit. &nbsp;How the effing fuck did you know I was going to say that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Because you
        <em>always</em> &nbsp;say that. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your go-to story on why Parp is a sociopath. &nbsp;You know? &nbsp;For trying
            to break up your marriage? &nbsp;Plus I think you&rsquo;ve told me that story at least once every couple weeks
            since it happened two years ago. &nbsp;I feel like I was there with you for the whole six months except I never
            got hump Desiree. &nbsp;I know about the smell of garlic and cannabis coming from Parp&rsquo;s neighbor&rsquo;s
            apartment. &nbsp;I know that Desiree had an issue with you seeing her ass while the lights were on. &nbsp;I know
            about the pillows stacked on Parp&rsquo;s bed. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thinking of moving to L.A. just so I can hang
            with people who never heard about you and Parp and Desiree.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Holy shit. &nbsp;Are you saying a lot of people know about this? &nbsp;You know, my thing with Desiree? &nbsp;Because
        dude it would not be good if it got back to Kandace.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I was exaggerating for effect. &nbsp;There are plenty of people I can hang with in New York
        who don&rsquo;t know about your affair.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it an &lsquo;affair,&rsquo; man.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well whatever you
        <em>would</em>
        &nbsp;call it? &nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t that many people who know about it. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think. &nbsp;But look. &nbsp;If
        you&rsquo;re so worried about it getting back to Kandace then you maybe shouldn&rsquo;t talk about it so much.&rdquo;

    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Um&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t say I talked about it a lot, man. &nbsp;Okay maybe I told you a few times and of course
        Parp knows. &nbsp;You think I can trust Parp, right?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his rep.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He seemed relieved. &nbsp;Then he laughed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah. &nbsp;Okay. &nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s
        <em>one</em> &nbsp;of his reps.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Somewhere in there the two of us drifted all the way out of the hotel and when we got outside we lit up. &nbsp;There were
        some other people out there smoking too and we were all standing beneath this awning to the side of the big circular
        drive that leads from Sixth Avenue to the hotel entrance.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, well when Parp asked me for that girl&rsquo;s number that Christmas? &nbsp;Like I owed it to him because he
        let me meet Desiree in his apartment? &nbsp;I pushed back. &nbsp;I let him know I didn&rsquo;t owe him shinola.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But you sort of did, didn&rsquo;t you, Kurt? &nbsp;I mean, letting you meet a chick in his apartment a night or two
        a week for months&hellip; that&rsquo;s substantial. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t think you owed him
        <em>anything</em>
        &nbsp;for that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know how they say &lsquo;fuck that&rsquo; sometimes? &nbsp;You know: &lsquo;fuck that&rsquo;?&rsquo;&rdquo; he
        asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay well me owing Parp? &nbsp;
        <em>Fuck that</em>
        . &nbsp;He said he was doing it for liberation or something. &nbsp;Freedom. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s how he
        gets his wood then hey man, liberation it is. &nbsp;So he got to feel like a revolutionary and I got to throw Desiree
        the joy-toy on his ninety-nine pillows. &nbsp;It was a trade.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Pretty unequal though, wouldn&rsquo;t you say? &nbsp;I mean with me all he did was let me use his gold card. &nbsp;With
        you he had to go find shit to do two nights a week.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Okay, so I
        <em>liked</em> &nbsp;the guy,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;He was exasperated. &nbsp;He stomped out his cigarette butt like it was
            an angry cockroach looking for food on his face. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was, what&rsquo;s the word, &lsquo;dispensed&rsquo;...
            um&hellip; &lsquo;disposed&rsquo; to do him a favor back then. &nbsp;I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to have him dictate
            what the favor was. &nbsp;Ya know? &nbsp;Ya know?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I get it,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the deal was &lsquo;pay me back now or I&rsquo;ll go around telling people you and your wife remind
        me of
        <em>Jude the Obscure</em>
        ,&rsquo;&rdquo; he raged.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;With cats instead of kids!&rdquo; I gigcackled.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is you need to watch out. &nbsp;Now he thinks he&rsquo;s free to demand shit from you. &nbsp;Just
        wait. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        We went back into the lounge and he poured us something. &nbsp;I think it was club soda and lime. &nbsp;At first I was hoping
        for free alcohol, but&hellip; I was good with keeping a clear head that night. &nbsp;Plus, lime and club soda can
        be kind of refreshing.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What do you think Parp&rsquo;s going to ask you for?&rdquo; he grinned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re like the undertaker
        in the
        <em>Godfather</em>.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then he pulled out his Brando impression: &nbsp;&ldquo;One day, and that day may never
        come, I will call upon you to do a service for me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He laughed. &nbsp;I gigcackled.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So what do you think he&rsquo;s going to demand?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I looked through the lounge doorway to the lobby. &nbsp;There was this fountain out there with this Greek guy&rsquo;s head
        or maybe it was a Roman guy&rsquo;s head carved into the marble at the top. &nbsp;And all I could think was: I was
        pretty sure Parp already had what he wanted.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;All he wants is to be a storybook hero,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
