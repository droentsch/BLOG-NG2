	<div class="chapterSubhead">I Flirt With Cammy</div>
	<div class='body'>When I got done with my close-up the filmtards immediately started setting up the next one without even a five-minute break.&nbsp;&nbsp;That
		was pretty cool because no break meant they wouldn&rsquo;t be bugging me and Cammy with chit-chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I jammed
		up to where Cammy was sitting on the risers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I practically ran.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have run, too, but I didn&rsquo;t
		want to lose that cool, Noel-Coward &lsquo;tude just yet. So in my mind I still had the cocktail glass in one hand and
		the cigarette in the other.</div>
	<div class='body'>But as soon as I got up to her for some reason I forgot all about Noel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hee hee heeeeeeeeee ...&rdquo;
		I gigcackled.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>She furrowed her brow at me, so I cleared my throat and lowered my voice.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Rather a lot of fuss, no?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>whew</em>.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Would you mind frightfully if I took a seat?&rdquo; I asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>Now, it&rsquo;s a tiny space so up on the risers we were kind of in earshot of even Lenny and Main Cunt on the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		mean, unless we wanted to whisper really low &ndash; which is no way to continue breaking ice that got started breaking
		by a chick framing her cunt at me &ndash; there was no way we could have a private conversation in that theatre.</div>
	<div class='body'>And what made my mind up for me was the fact that I could see Bangalore Springfield looking around for somebody to chat
		up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured it would be a matter of seconds before he horned in. So I said, &ldquo;Ya know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re
		not going to need me for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going out to grab a smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to get a coffee or something?&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		mean, it &lsquo;s what, half an hour till we&rsquo;re done for the day, anyway?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She said okay and we jammed out of there before Bang or anyone else could interrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;She jammed
		out after me.</div>
	<div class='body'>So there we are on the sidewalk and I unpack a smoke and light it up while we&rsquo;re walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ya know,&rdquo;
		I said, forgetting all about Noel Coward again, &ldquo;I can remember when we used to call these fags.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee-heeeeeeeee
		...&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Right then I&rsquo;m thinking:
		<em>Look, she followed me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been getting pussy for decades with this same gigcackle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe
			I shouldn&rsquo;t try to hide it.</em> Besides, trying to remember to be all suave and low-voiced was starting to bruise
		my forehead.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Where we going?&rdquo; she asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>Fair enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just started down the sidewalk with a kind of swagger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thought we&rsquo;d grab
		a coffee,&rdquo; I said.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Bux?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s three blocks away.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gotta get back for Belinda before
		she wonders where I went.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Belinda.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s the photog?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Okay, this Belinda chick she was talking about was the still photographer.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been out to LittleRoundJewishHatTheVideo.com
		you&rsquo;ve seen her work.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all that &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; crap.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much
		all I knew about her back then though was that she had an ass like my Kansas City babe&rsquo;s: nice and big.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
		big, firm, thong-devouring cock cushion under a thin waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wearing the same style low-rise jeans as
		Cammy: bell-bottoms, except Cammy&rsquo;s were button-fly.</div>
	<div class='body'>I&rsquo;ve always favored buttons on the cunt gate.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>And Belinda had really curly red hair and was hanging aloof from the crowd and clickety-click-clicking away, and every now
		and then laughing with Parp.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I saw that &ndash; Belinda laughing with Parp &ndash; I was afraid it meant she might be wanting him to fuck her sometime
		soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I felt the urge to intervene &mdash; for her sake, but I was distracted by the cock-gobbler
		lips of Main Cunt and then, of course, the whole Cammy thing happened.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t drive,&rdquo; Cammy said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her ride.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>There goes the blowjob</em>.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, all right,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ya wanna just stand here and talk while I smoke?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
		that okay?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;She squinted and pushed her hair out of her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I swung around so
		she wouldn&rsquo;t be looking into the sun that was pretty much down already anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I&rsquo;m thoughtful
		like that and I bank on chicks noticing and remembering.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Definitely like your jeans,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to gigcackle but caught it in time to turn it to
		a hiss. A friendly hiss.</div>
	<div class='body'>She smiled kind of shy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the first and last time she ever blushed in front of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
		she giggled and I noticed she had a kind of odd laugh herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of between a giggle and a chuckle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		didn&rsquo;t find it objectionable, but I knew that I could pretend that I did if it ever came to recriminations.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Parp&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; she asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;So is it just my imagination or did you frame your cunt at me?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She gigchuckled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I framed it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You wanna lick it.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Now we were back on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it kinda crossed my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;With some other stuff.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Other stuff?&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonna teach me some
		<em>stuff</em>, Daddy?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>That was weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have gulped.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Does that bother you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Want me to pretend you&rsquo;re thirty?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty good in my own skin.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;How you gonna be in
		<em>my</em>
		skin,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;She furrowed her brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a weird thing you do, that laugh,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you want to
		be taken seriously, but then the laugh says you&rsquo;re just kidding or it&rsquo;s all lighthearted or something.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>So the gigcackle was definitely out.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a laugh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing psychological or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
		just the way I laugh.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just ... it sounds like what a little boy does when he wants to be taken
		seriously and not seriously at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, he wants something but he doesn&rsquo;t want to get blamed
		if it turns out that what he wants is bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, &lsquo;Hey Susie, wanna go out in the woods so I can fuck
		you in your butt?...Hee-hee-hee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only joking Susie!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hey Auntie Karen, you wanna lick my cock
		shaft?&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;Hee-hee-hee. Kidding Auntie Karen!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I couldn&rsquo;t believe she was riffing on me like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a laugh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake!</div>
	<div class='body'>I was quiet for a few seconds after she said that and just puffed my cigarette.&nbsp;&nbsp;So she said, &ldquo;Hey.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
		sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do that a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m, well, kind of a writer so I&rsquo;m
		always like trying to figure out what it means when people do stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, the stuff they do.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh look.&nbsp;&nbsp;A chick in Manhattan who&rsquo;s kind of a writer.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the odds?</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Parp thinks he&rsquo; s kind of a writer and he&rsquo;s always doing that
		kind of stuff with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay, really.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never really met Parp,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Fuck my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to mention Parp.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wound a little tight.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to set him off?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him you won&rsquo;t put any
		pill in your mouth unless it&rsquo;s FDA-approved.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He has a really thin waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like a vee.&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that tight shirt it&rsquo;s like
		you can see the muscles in his abs.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t muscle, it&rsquo;s loose skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; But gay men are into him.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>She laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
		<em>bet</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;So is he bi?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s straight,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can definitely see Parp
		with dick in his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big, black dick.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I thought that would get a big laugh out of her but she looked at her watch instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Belinda&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo;
		for me!&rdquo; she sang.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I better be getting back to that theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
		gotta be in Nassau County at seven-thirty.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So when are we gonna, you know ...&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;We have plenty of time ...&rdquo; she sing-songed again.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I
		<em>know</em>,&rdquo; I whined.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of like a little boy.</div>
	<div class='body'>She gigchuckled at that.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Your email is on the contact sheet, right?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you want to tell me
		something first?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh yeah, hey,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad we met, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re, um, you&rsquo;re
		&ndash;&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh Jesus, I don&rsquo;t want to hear
		<em>that</em>.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;I mean aren&rsquo;t you going to tell me that you&rsquo;re married or something?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m ...&nbsp;&nbsp;married or something.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess you won&rsquo;t be telling my boyfriend that I&rsquo;m yours, yours, yours, huh?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;And you better fix that laugh.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Marriage in, laugh out.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Married men give the
		<em>best</em>
		rim jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; See you tomorrow!&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And she turned and dashed away to the theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of gulped and watched that perfectly round ass as it went.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		mean, for me actual rim jobs are definitely out, but hearing her say those words gave me a cock that could punch out sissies.</div>
