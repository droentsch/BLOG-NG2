        I didn&rsquo;t know why Bang was interested, but
        it was something to talk about while waiting for the sweaty film
        boys to get things squared away or their shit together or their
        film all on a roll or whatever they call it when their asses are
        finally in gear.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I told Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You could
        say Libby hates Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a fashion.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And yeah, it&rsquo;s the same Kurt Libby I told
        you about way back in that early chapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter five or six or
        something.&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tubby-fuck ex-wrestler from Ann Arbor
        who got the serial blowjob from Constance that weekend so long ago
        when we were all just barely out of high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt Libby of the
        Kurt and Constance Episode, the event that drove me into therapy
        and made me come to terms with my need to be lord of all
        tail.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        To the extent that I <em>have</em>
        come to terms
        with it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Kurt&rsquo;s around.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
        I told Bang, he tends bar in the restaurant at the Commodore Hotel,
        the big one on Sixth Avenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;He poured Bill Clinton a drink
        once.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Wife, no kids but three cats, lives near
        Riverside Drive in the Nineties.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        When we graduated from college Kurt belonged to
        that little group of kids I decided I could live without ever
        seeing again, so it was a good decade or so before I ran into him
        even though we only lived about thirty blocks from each other
        in Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994 I went down to Soho to auditon for Depth
        Charge Repertory Theater and boom, there was Kurt Libby on the other side of the table: a lot
        thinner and almost no hair.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Kurt was a member of Depth Charge Rep and after
        my interview and audition he recommended me to be a member, bygones
        being bygones and water being under the bridge the way it often is
        when time passes and you wonder what happened to your old chums and
        you wish you could see them again just to to tell them it&rsquo;s
        okay.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So there we were, me and Kurt Libby in the
        mid-1990s, members of Depth Charge Rep, which back in those days
        used to call itself the &ldquo;Home of Literate Theatre&rdquo; and
        produced almost exclusively Oscar Wilde plays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics found that
        weird &ndash; a bunch of Americans off-Broadway doing British
        comedy from a century earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;So then it became the &ldquo;Home of
        Dangerous Theater&rdquo; and every production we did was pretty
        much a new play about people in square relationships who end up
        having strange sex with partners they later have to kill.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Critics thought we were a lot better suited to 
        that kind of play than we were to <em>Salome</em>
        and <em>Lady
            Windermere&rsquo;s Fan</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We did a few critically-acclaimed shows, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        See, right about then was when the <em>New York Times</em>
        hired a
        guy to go around reviewing off-Broadway shows instead of just
        Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And a couple years later was when theatres started having
        websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Before that you had to advertise or get publicity 
        in newspapers and magazines and that was a struggle in and of 
        itself &ndash; raising money for advertising and press agents  
        &ndash; never mind mounting the actual <em>show</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So in the Eighties you could make magic and
        pretty much be ignored by everyone &ndash; unless you had
        connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you didn&rsquo;t have the connections yourself
        you could pay out the ass for a press agent&rsquo;s connections
        &ndash; which he or she delivered on maybe half the time.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But like I said in the mid-to-late Nineties all 
        that started to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could actually get a public presence  
        and a <em>New York Times</em>
        review without having to pay
        extortion to some reptile who left slime wherever she fed.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Depth Charge did three or four shows that the <em>New York Times</em>
        guy &ndash; I forget his name right now 
        &ndash; just loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one &ndash; the biggest deal &ndash;  
        was this play called <em>Smileshine</em>, which was sort of a 
        sequel to <em>Death of a Salesman</em>
        only not written by Arthur
        Miller, so the writer had to be careful about not using the same
        character names and other legal stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt and me played the late Billy
        Corman&rsquo;s aging sons, Riff and Slappy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the
        end of the first act, Riff (me) drills Slappy&rsquo;s wife up the
        ass while she begs him not to, and in the third act, just before
        the lights come down, she blows his brains out with Slappy&rsquo;s
        twelve-gauge while he begs her not to.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We did ninety-six performances and got great
        reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;Celebs came to see us.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the clippings.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then right after it closed a lot of ego shit
        happened and envy shit and bottom line? We all got pissed off at
        each other and the company broke up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt and me were pretty down
        about it but we kept the friendship going.&nbsp;&nbsp;Off and on we still talk
        about maybe putting another troupe together or maybe just doing
        another show but so far we haven&rsquo;t really done anything about
        it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        When we first hooked back up &ndash; back in the
        Nineties when I ran into him at Depth Charge &ndash; we had a lot
        of laughs about the ol&rsquo; college days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we had to
        deal with the Kurt and Constance episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it behind us, get it
        out of the way, laugh about it.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I needed to be lord of all tail,&rdquo; I
        confessed, although putting it in the past tense made it less of a
        confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what got me into
        therapy.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I told him all about Fritz Koch and my problem.
        He seemed really sympathetic, almost ashamed, like you get when
        you&rsquo;re really hard on somebody for being a jackass and later
        you find out they&rsquo;ve got valid emotional issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like
        he realized that even though it was my fault for acting like a
        paranoid freak, in another sense it wasn&rsquo;t my fault that it
        was my fault.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We got a little misty.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
        drank beers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And over those same years Libby and Parp got
        pretty tight, even though Parp had zero to do with Depth Charge Rep
        except to come to a few performances.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he was trying to fuck
        one of the actresses at one point but I never found out what was
        really going on there.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I know is one night she was crying and
        the next night she said she was going to nail Parp&rsquo;s cock to
        the call board.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And even though I was tight with Libby and Parp
        was tight with him the three of us never hung together, except
        maybe for one Christmas party where Parp showed up for a few hours.
        He was starting to click with some short chick with spiky hair but
        he split before he got any info on her other than her first name,
        so later he called up Kurt for her phone number or email or
        something.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And Kurt turned him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No can do,
        Parpy,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a
        boyfriend.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Now, that might not sound like such a terrible
        objection: Loyalty is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you could say that Kurt was
        being a little presumptuous.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have let the girl speak for
        herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least his heart was in the right place,
        right?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Well, here&rsquo;s the thing: for about a year 
        before that Kurt had been fucking an actress from Depth Charge, and 
        I think I might have already mentioned that he was, how shall I  
        phrase this: <em>married</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now who&rsquo;s a guy to turn to
        when he needs to fuck around on his wife and not get judged for it?
        Parp , of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is Parp not married himself but he
        thinks marriage is a feudal institution that kills the souls of the
        participating humans.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So Libby goes to Parp, tells him his marriage has
        turned into a big gray photo of life in prison, and by the way can
        he use Parp&rsquo;s apartment to bang his babe in?
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp says yes, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amoral turd.&nbsp;&nbsp;Six 
        months later Kurt and the actress get tired of fucking each other  
        and two months after <em>that</em>
        Libby tells Parp he won&rsquo;t
        give him a chick&rsquo;s phone number because she has a
        boyfriend.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        So I asked Libby when I heard about it:
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that was a weird place to start taking
        a stand for monogamy?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I gigcackled when I asked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were at a diner
        on Ninety-Second and Broadway.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He seemed taken off guard.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, ya know ...&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I 
        mean, some, some <em>things</em>, I mean <em>relationships</em>,
        have to be respected,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He stared at me like it was real important I buy
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just gigcackled.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, look, 
        it&rsquo;s like this, okay? I guess I had a bit of a crush on this  
        girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;What you call a <em>crush</em>, you know? And, you know,
        there was Parp acting like I wasn&rsquo;t even there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of like,
        &lsquo;Yeah, Kurt couldn&rsquo;t be anything to this girl, the only
        thing Kurt could be good for is getting her information for me,
        Tony Parp.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He took a long quaff of beer, then said:
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I wasn&rsquo;t even there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I&rsquo;m a
        fat guy or out of it or I don&rsquo;t have a dick.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what
        that&rsquo;s like?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Indeed I do.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Even after Kurt refused to give Parp the
        girl&rsquo;s number, the two of them still worked on a bunch of
        crap together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly short films.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But their friendship had definitely reached its <em>denouement</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;One day I&rsquo;m sitting over on that big
        green couch with a scotch in my hand and I&rsquo;m thinking,
        &lsquo;What the fuck is wrong?&rsquo; Ever have a moment like that?
        I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Shit, something&rsquo;s been wrong for a
        long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;What.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it?&rsquo; And then it came into my
        head, like a little message handwritten on a post-it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
        Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what I mean? He&rsquo;s just fucking depressing the
        shit out of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I was around this guy for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
        starting to feel like a sell-out for having a wife and cats and not
        fucking the first slut he pushed my way.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He waved at the waittress for another beer there.
        Or maybe he wanted the check.&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember him waving.
        &ldquo;You know how he does that, right?&rdquo; he asked.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Parp pushes sluts your way?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You know how it&rsquo;s like ...&nbsp;&nbsp;okay.
        You&rsquo;re hanging with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re just talking about
        normal day-to-day shit, then suddenly he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;You
        gotta have a gym in your apartment.&rsquo; And you&rsquo;re like,
        &lsquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s an idea, where do I put it?&rsquo; and
        he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of room as soon as
        you get rid of the wife and cats.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;The cats, too?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Huh-huh-huh,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You
        know, okay, not the cats, but you know Parp, man, to do the
        littlest thing you have to change your life completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
        bottom-line, end-of-day, take-away thing? Parp depressed me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Day
        in, day out, no matter what I wanted to do I was starting to think
        I had to change my whole life to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;One day &ndash; no shit,
        this honest-to-God happened &ndash; It&rsquo;s Sunday and real
        quiet and I&rsquo;m out getting a Red Bull and I&rsquo;m thinking,
        &lsquo;I have to audition more.&rsquo; And that makes me sad
        because the next thing I think is, &lsquo;How am I going to tell
        Kandace I&rsquo;m moving out?&rsquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So I stopped returning Parp&rsquo;s calls 
        and after awhile I got back to feeling like, &lsquo;Hey, I <em>like</em>
        my wife and cats.&rsquo; It made Kandace happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
        was sure Parp was going to roll some piece of snatch my way and
        I&rsquo;d end up popping it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So Kandace didn&rsquo;t trust you, huh
        Kurt?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t trust Parp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Know what I
        mean?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp&rsquo;s side of the story was shorter: 
        &ldquo;Kurt and Kandace Libby remind me of <em>Jude the
            Obscure</em>
        only with cats instead of kids,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I never read <em>Jude the Obscure</em>
        but when I
        mentioned to Libby that Parp said he and Kandace reminded him of 
        that book Libby kind of freaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever since then whenever 
        Parp&rsquo;s name comes up all he can say is, &ldquo;Fuck that guy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Fuck <em>that</em>
        guy.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have said
        anything.
    </div>
