        Ladies and Gentlemen: Bangalore Springfield
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        One of Parp&rsquo;s pals back then was &mdash; and I guess still is &mdash; an &ldquo;Indian&rdquo;
        stand-up comic named Bangalore Springfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven&rsquo;t heard of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
        hell, who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time anyone reads this he may have had his Friar&rsquo;s
        Roast already or whatever it is they call that thing they do on that
        channel.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I saw his act down at Vider&rsquo;s once.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it
        wasn&rsquo;t embarrassing to watch like a lot of live comedy shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;His act is
        pretty much about what it&rsquo;s like to be a goofy foreigner in a goofy
        country with goofy parents and a goofy job while trying to fuck somebody
        with a sweet ass.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        In his act he&rsquo;s got this thick Indian accent.&nbsp;&nbsp;In real life he sounds like
        he comes from Brooklyn or maybe Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has
        this almost permanent squint in his right eye that everyone notices but
        nobody mentions.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        On that first day of shooting <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        &mdash; two days
        after vanquishing the wife in the previously-narrated, no-holds-barred
        domestic smackdown &mdash; Bang and I were standing sort of next to each other
        while the film crew did film crew work just a few feet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had this
        big grin on his face like he was thrilled to be there.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Amateur.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp was up on a ladder twisting a bolt into a big theatre light.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just
        finished asking him if he was still enjoying Christine, the hot blonde
        forty year-old.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I was seeing Christine for a couple months,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but she kept
        telling me that women don&rsquo;t like guys with really long hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;And women
        don&rsquo;t like guys who spend a lot of time shopping for moisturizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
        women don&rsquo;t like guys who look at themselves in the mirror all the time.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In other words, women don&rsquo;t like <em>you</em>.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Uh ...&nbsp;&nbsp;heh-<em>heh!</em>
        &rdquo; Bang laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The laugh took me by surprise.
        It was like hearing a goose hiccup.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Parp said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Finally I told her to stop calling herself &lsquo;women.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I tell my wife, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a man, I haven&rsquo;t got the slightest
        idea what men want.&nbsp;&nbsp;You think because you&rsquo;ve got a g-spot you get to
        speak for the four billion other people with g-spots?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a nose.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
        speaking as the haver of a nose, I&rsquo;d like you to stop talking and start
        blowing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Start blowing your nose?&rdquo; I asked.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Good catch,&rdquo; said Bang, &ldquo;I should definitely change that to &lsquo;sucking&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Fucking comics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every conversation is a rehearsal.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Or make it about something besides your cock,&rdquo; said Bobby Whispers, who
        was up on another ladder next to Parp&rsquo;s.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is show business.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be a blowjob.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Bobby gave him a funny look.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang gave him a funny look back.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp was grim.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s really funny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that they think they know what women
        want because it&rsquo;s what they, their friends, and Oprah want.&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&rsquo;t
        know you can walk three blocks and find women who think Oprah is a frigid
        twat.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Any bar on the Lower East Side.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Then Bobby said: &ldquo;Mondi pretty much thinks Oprah&rsquo;s a frigid ...&nbsp;&nbsp;y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re shitting me!&rdquo; I laughed.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Maybe not in those words, but, um ...&nbsp;&nbsp;ya know what?&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to tell
        her that and she may put it in her next tattoo.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang did that goose-hiccup again.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Lucky bastard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispers, I mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;In case you don&rsquo;t know, Mondi McDade 
        wrote <em>Not on the Hood of My Car</em>
        which was on the radio five
        times an hour in the Summer of &rsquo;83.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she had tattoos, which were not
        really that common on babes in the eighties.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his <em>Rolling Stone</em>
        interview Derek Mool of the Belly Shells said that the best blowjob he&rsquo;d ever
        gotten was from Mondi McDade.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I think Oprah&rsquo;s a frigid twat.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        It was a chick&rsquo;s voice, so we all turned to look.&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice belonged to a
        stand-in sitting on the set getting lights on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she shouted to a bunch of chicks sitting out in the chairs, &ldquo;is
        Oprah a frigid twat or what?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        They all shouted &ldquo;twat&rdquo; and &ldquo;fuck Oprah.&rdquo; Some of them clapped.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a rigid twat Oprah can suck,&rdquo; one of them said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Rigid?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a stiff little post the twat can lick for me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I think I may have shivered a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like: <em>this is my home
            and these are my people</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Babes who say things like &ldquo;suck my snatch&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;gimme that cock.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I cursed myself for all the times I&rsquo;d taken them for granted.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And right now, remembering those girls, those lovably sloppy girls who I 
        later denounced in a fit of middle-class <em>hauteur</em>
        brought on by a
        reawakened &ldquo;spirituality&rdquo; (oh God if I could only go back in time and
        kick myself in the balls!) a tear nearly comes to my eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just 
        remembering that day we shot <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        ...
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        That <em>first</em> day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; I&rsquo;m getting all misty just from thinking about
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a whole mind-set.&nbsp;&nbsp;God I wish I could go back and hug every
        single one of the little twats.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        But enough of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the damn story.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Actually, that first day we were shooting only a couple scenes from the
        video.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were going to shoot a couple more down at Vider&rsquo;s the next
        day.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Here&rsquo;s how that first day&rsquo;s location was laid out.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        We were at a tiny theatre in the garment district of New York City about
        three blocks from Madison Square Garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shooting in a black box off-off
        Broadway is a lot cheaper than renting a soundstage someplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the
        sound was going to be re-recorded in a studio anyway so nobody cared
        about the sound of the car horns and the sirens and the pneumatic drills
        that bled in from the street while shooting the image.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The tiny off-off theatre?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was called Hannibal&rsquo;s Demise.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s where
        Parp and pals decided to do their shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our shooting.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Picture this.&nbsp;&nbsp;You walk into a small office building.&nbsp;&nbsp;You go to the
        elevator bank at the back of the lobby and there&rsquo;s a big door next to the
        elevator doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over this door is a sign that says, &ldquo;Hannibal&rsquo;s Demise.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        (The guy who rents the place out pronounces it, &ldquo;duh-MEEZ.&rdquo; Yes, he is a
        pansy.)
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        You go through that big door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly you&rsquo;re surrounded by risers.&nbsp;&nbsp;On
        the risers are chairs like movie theatre chairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s an aisle through
        these risers that leads to a so-called stage that&rsquo;s really just a
        platform one foot off the floor and painted black.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Everything</em>
        is
        painted black.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you took the stage and risers out it would look exactly
        like the empty cellar in the house of a suburban dominatrix.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The stage walls were draped in bright green fabric so that a different
        background could be composited in later like they did with Star Wars. 
        They can do that shit on a Mac.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp ended up doing it for <em>Little
            Round Jewish Hat</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        The stand-in &mdash; the pretty dark chick who screamed out, &ldquo;is Oprah a frigid
        twat or what?&rdquo; &mdash; was sitting right in the middle of the stage about five
        feet in front of the green screen.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And the chicks who called back to her were sprawled out in the theatre
        seats on the risers like a bunch of mostly-fuckable girl-slobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coats
        everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;A prop table.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big boxes of crap ...&nbsp;&nbsp;a portable freezer for
        sodas and a table with donuts and coffee.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Gotta have your donuts and coffee.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        And Whispers and Parp?&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said they were climbing around on ladders
        along the green screen with some blonde Brit-boy they called the
        &ldquo;gaffetographer&rdquo; because he was both cinematographer and gaffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had
        tape and twine and a big stapler they kept handing back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
        were two guys with black t-shirts adjusting settings on the camera really
        carefully like it was a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guys and the camera were
        between the stage and the risers.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Me and Bang were standing kind of next to the camera guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;We each had a
        cup of coffee in our hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Makeup babe was about to get to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Costume
        babe had just checked our inseams.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Ever meet one of those chicks who is essentially an armpit in a jumpsuit?
        That was costume babe so ...&nbsp;&nbsp;no inseam titillation that day.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Sitting just behind us was Lenny Paine, the &ldquo;star&rdquo; of the video &mdash; the guy
        who sings the song and loses his yarmulke.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was getting all made up and
        wearing this costume that was just some lame suit that a college prof
        might wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;His jacket-with-elbow-patches was pitched out on the risers
        somewhere behind him until he was actually needed on set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some young girl
        &mdash; maybe fifteen with an incredible rack and exposed cleavage &mdash; was making 
        up his <em>hands</em>
        for Christ&rsquo;s sake.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So what are you doing here?&rdquo; Bang asked me.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an actor, hence the makeup and threads,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh yeah, me too.&nbsp;&nbsp;No makeup though.&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason my skin is
        brownish-colored already.&rdquo; He took a sip of his coffee from the
        donut-shop paper cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe they could make my eyebrows darker?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nahhhh ...&nbsp;&nbsp;your eyebrows are to die for.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So what do you do in real life?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your job?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What &mdash; what do you mean?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your job, how do you make a living?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m an actor-slash-model.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;And when you&rsquo;re not modeling actor slashes what do you do?&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard you
        were a bartender at one of the Blarney Stones in midtown.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I cleared my throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, a self-deprecating cough.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you watch
        sitcoms you know the kind of cough I mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I tend bar at one of the
        Irish Taverns at midtown.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one on Fiftieth near Broadway.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;And of course you would not want to be mistaken for a Blarney Stoner.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Shit, I&rsquo;m thinking, a second ago I was an actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m a fucking <em>bartender</em>.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Did Parp tell you that?&nbsp;&nbsp;That I&rsquo;m a bartender?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a secret?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well ...&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why are you so touchy about it?&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have day jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the
        comedy thing is kind of picking up for me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Well ...&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been getting some good bites at auditions,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;He
        smiled at me like he could tell I was full of shit.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;were you born in India?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jewish.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Astoria.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;But you do such a great Indian accent.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they call it an &lsquo;act&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;now who&rsquo;s being defensive?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being defensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m yanking your chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you know it as
        busting your balls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or your chops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or your shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Stop me when I hit a
        noun you recognize.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you find this whole video vaguely ...&nbsp;&nbsp;insulting?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t find it just a touch anti-Semitic?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Jew gets the girl?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he sings and dances in broad
        daylight in the middle of Soho?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;I was thinking the whole thing about calling a yarmulke a &lsquo;little round
        Jewish hat.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        He laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What, so he should call it a large square Arab hat?&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        This was starting to piss me off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang looked up at Parp on the ladder.
        &ldquo;Hey Parp!&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You anti-Semite you! How dare you call it a
        little round Jewish hat?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Parp looked at Bang and furrowed his brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looked at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;He
        rolled his eyes.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Bang laughed again.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        I really wanted the spotlight off me at that moment.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s your real name?&rdquo; I asked, thinking I might get him on the
        defensive for a second.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Bangalore Springfield.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Ringo Calzone.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re shitting me.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am shitting you.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        How do you talk to a guy like that?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was all ready to find someplace
        else to stand when he said: &ldquo;Hey, doesn&rsquo;t Kurt Libby work at the Irish
        Stone Blarney?&nbsp;&nbsp;You know him?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentence that wasn&rsquo;t trying to kick my ass.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Went to school with him too.&nbsp;&nbsp;He tends bar in the
        restaurant at the Commodore Hotel, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s kind of down the street
        from where I work.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        Bang crushed his cup.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Libby really hates Parp, huh?&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class='body'>
        &ldquo;Sure seems like it.&rdquo;
    </div>
</div>
