        Biz Trumps Ex-Hooker
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The wife said something about going out for dinner, I said I don&rsquo;t wanna, the boy laughed, the wife said okay I&rsquo;ll change my clothes and we&rsquo;ll order in some Chinese pizza, which is just Chinese food piled on a pizza.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry was out of school for two weeks with pneumonia last year and he invented Chinese pizza one night while I was trying to explain <em>The X Files</em>
        to him. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The only problem with CP is it&rsquo;s two deliveries, which means two tips.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what the heck.&nbsp;&nbsp;A little tiny splurge now and then wasn&rsquo;t going to drain our shallow pockets. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So Junior put on jeans and a pink t-shirt with a huge, indelible hair-dye stain on it and the three of us heaped pork fried rice on a cheese pizza and divvied it up. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Tasty. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The wife seemed happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just chirping along.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all noshing away, not talking about day jobs. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That&rsquo;s the rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;No talking about day jobs at the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;That night I kind of wanted it <em>not</em>
        to be the rule though, because I knew that the rule meant there could be no more talking about Hed and the MoHum gang.&nbsp;&nbsp;It meant I couldn&rsquo;t talk about Kenny the beertard, who was this incompetent so-called bartender I sometimes had to share a shift with.&nbsp;&nbsp;It meant  Junior&rsquo;s head would be ranging around for crap to kill the silence with. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So what did you and Parp talk about?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Same old Parp shit,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Same old Parp shit,&rdquo; Sam said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; Junior said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Daddy said it.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Daddy says a lot of things,&rdquo; Junior said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do <em>not</em>
        want you repeating words you know are bad.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Sorry, Sam,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it, either.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;<em>You</em>
        shouldn&rsquo;t have said it, <em>either</em>,&rdquo; Sam said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I thought Parp had a project he wanted to talk about,&rdquo; Junior said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I forgot I told her that. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, some Parp thing going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing much.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She picked up this tall glass of diet cola and stared at me over the rim and across the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;A shark&rsquo;s-eye stare.&nbsp;&nbsp;A stare that wanted to know if I had blood in me or if I was just some trash floating the surf. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I knew <em>exactly</em>
        what she was thinking:  Do I nail him now for what he&rsquo;s hiding about the conversation he had with Parp or do I wait until the boy is in the sack? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Just some thing he&rsquo;s got going,&rdquo; I said, like: nothing to worry about, give me some credit for protecting your brain from the musings of the human turd. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So we talked about other stuff and it was deadly trivial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time Junior opened her mouth to talk about Obama or her big fat mother or the movies it was about some molecular detail, a neuron-killer, like she wanted me to know we would be talking baby talk until I agreed to tell her about whatever it was Parp told me. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She couldn&rsquo;t wait to climb up my colon. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Right after the Chinese pizza she put the boy to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like she ambushed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;No TV time, no chit-chat, no listening to Daddy&rsquo;s Dylan with him for a little while first. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Even Sammy noticed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are we <em>going</em>
        so fast?&rdquo; he asked her at one point while they were in the bathroom. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bedtime,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bedtime is like a deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;You always race to meet a deadline.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        A lame crock of shit, but kids are stupid so he bought it. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        When she was finally done with him and turned out the light in the boys&rsquo; bedroom and closed the door really gently so Sammy wouldn&rsquo;t be traumatized by the sound of a latch clicking, she turned around and looked at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at me for a sec then ducked her eyes away and went over to the sink in the kitchen area and picked up a dish rag.&nbsp;&nbsp;The faucet, the suds. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now you single kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;You listen up.&nbsp;&nbsp;This going over to do the dishes was not about Junior wanting to get tidy.&nbsp;&nbsp;No sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about giving me the assignment of starting a conversation she wanted to have. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And something you should know about me from Chapter One is I don&rsquo;t like getting assignments. So fuck the presumptuous twat.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to play games, hey, Daddy <em>loves</em>
        a good game. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Here hon, I&rsquo;ll do those,&rdquo; I said, like I had no idea she&rsquo;d given me the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s a bartender, after all,&rdquo; I kind of sang in my falsetto daddy-voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He swabs the deck for a living while Mommy argues about burqas with deep-drilling Hed.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I pushed my glasses up on my nose. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She gave no sign of being entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t say anything or look at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She just went into the living-room area and sat on the sofa. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hey hon?&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;<em>What? </em>&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She was getting pissed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, the way chicks get when you don&rsquo;t read their minds fast enough. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Hey Baby, Daddy&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; your dishes for ya,&rdquo;  I giggled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I mentioned I have a high giggle, a girlish giggle, like a cross between a giggle and a cackle. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Paul, are you going to tell me what&rsquo;s going on with Tony?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked, like making her start her own conversation was an act of misogyny. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I was kinda waitin&rsquo;,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right now is pretty much the best time to talk, don&rsquo;tcha think?&nbsp;&nbsp;Kids are snoozin&rsquo;, Mommy and Daddy can do some serious ... <em>stuff</em>.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I wriggled my eyes like Groucho Marx, like I was telling her if she played her cards right she might get her cunt opened extra deep later on, but that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen and she knew it. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;And ... you know ... yeah ...&rdquo; I continued in my high tentative falsetto.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my head I was starting to sound like Jimmy Stewart with clothespins on his scrotum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I did want to mention something ...&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She sat there like a statue. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Looks like Parp put together a crew and some actors for a music video &ndash; and oh yeah, and Bobby Whispers is in on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, he&rsquo;s&ndash;&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Mondi McDade&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; she said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I may have mentioned Bobby to her a couple times before. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She was sitting bolt upright, perfect posture, on the edge of the sofa.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she had a school desk in front of her, her little hands would have been folded on top of it. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, well, looks like they, um, they ... &rdquo; the clothespins tightened on my balls  &ldquo; ... need another actor, and they want yours truly.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then I gigcackled.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a reflex. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh my God, Paul,&rdquo; she said, and she hugged her arms and started rocking back and forth on the round of her ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are <em>not</em>
        leaving me here alone for another week.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        So that&rsquo;s what she was worried about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I had a project it was with Rob Crystell, and we spent three days &ndash; not a week &ndash; down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time I was up to my nuts in salt water while me and another guy and a couple Cuban babes made funny for the cameras in a satire Rob was shooting. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was called <em>Guys and Girls In Surf At the Beach</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It won a couple prizes. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It&rsquo;s great being the New York actor out-of-town.&nbsp;&nbsp;The local &ldquo;actresses&rdquo; automatically want your cock, except in this case Rob let them bring their boyfriends to the shoot to chaperone. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        What a fucking waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days of blue balls while beer-bellies walked off with the otherwise-available ass. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Anyway, while I was gone Junior got to find out firsthand what it was like to be a single working mommy with two small boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you could say she found it harrowing. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Babe!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;No!&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s one day of shooting here in Manhattan!&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I gave her my big sunny smile. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She slumped.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she smiled back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; she said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Although now that she told me I couldn&rsquo;t go away I of course wanted her to know that if I had an offer to go away I would fucking go. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So when are you shooting?&rdquo; she asked before I could make that point. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Day after tomorrow.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Saturday?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well ... yeah.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Pause. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Is Mondi McDade in the video?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Parp would have said something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe as a cameo.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well Paul, you can&rsquo;t do it Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry but not this Saturday.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You know you promised the boys you were taking them to Chuck E. Cheese this Saturday.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Long pause.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fumed.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no fucking way I was going to be sitting in the middle of toddler screams under snot projectiles when I could be hanging with New-York-actress cunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, you want to know why I&rsquo;m in New York as one of the world&rsquo;s best-educated midtown bartenders?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em>
        the banker money, or the broker money, or the doctor money? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Come on!&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason we&rsquo;re living in this dump is because we came to New York to be in the biz!&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are going to understand that Daddy needs to do some things to keep from blowing his fucking brains out!&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Shhhhh!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped up and padded over to me at the sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, &ldquo;This is not a dump.&nbsp;&nbsp;You take that back.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a dump,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Another long pause.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned back to the dishes while she stared up at my left ear. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take the kids Saturday?&rdquo; I asked. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already scheduled a play date for Saturday and I&rsquo;ve really been looking forward to it,&rdquo; she said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;A play date?&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m meeting Sue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sue Gasparino.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Sue Gasparino was an ex-hooker Junior met at one of those acting studios downtown.&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior was trying to hone her acting skills for re-entry into the biz, and she hit it off with ex-hooker Sue. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This is Sue:  long, kinky black curls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big nose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimal rack.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm ass with an exaggerated gape, like she has a spring between her cheeks pushing them open.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one time I met her she was wearing really tight low-rise jeans over a black leotard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair smelled like almond mint. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I turned back to Junior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to ... <em>play</em>
        with Sue Gasparino.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to go shopping,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And go out to a movie maybe and eat lunch.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But calling it a play date sounds like somebody plans to ... you know ...&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was <em>so</em>
        convinced I wouldn&rsquo;t go there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds like somebody&rsquo;s going to suck mound.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Her jaw dropped.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face turned red.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Paul, you are <em>not</em>
        going to get away with shirking your responsibilities by making me feel filthy.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        You may have noticed that was not a denial. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I didn&rsquo;t actually think Junior had it in her to get slurped out by Sue Gasparino.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calling it a &ldquo;play date&rdquo; was probably just an example of Sue&rsquo;s ex-hooker sense of humor. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But I was also pretty sure that if she was even slightly bi-curious Junior would spend the afternoon looking at Sue&rsquo;s mouth and imagining that ex-professional tongue butterflying her clit.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, my gothic-chasm aversion means I pretty much only eat Junior for her birthday and Christmas, and I missed last Christmas. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        You know, it&rsquo;s a kids-and-Santa day. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do I have to bring up the rule?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ya makin&rsquo; me play the rule card?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She looked blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a studied look.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule?&nbsp;&nbsp;What rule? 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Biz trumps vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biz trumps holidays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biz trumps day job,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        It was an old rule, but we always lived by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an opportunity comes up for us as actors we <em>have</em>
        to take it.&nbsp;&nbsp;No excuses. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She padded back to the sofa.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat down for a second and thought about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew I had her in a corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t beat the damn rule. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get him to change the day?&rdquo; she asked. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That took me off guard. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I think there are too many people involved,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll just use somebody else if I&rsquo;m not there.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then it started to rile me. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you think if I&rsquo;m involved in this it must be such a small deal that I can just ask the producers to change the date so you can go shopping with Wide-Gape Sue.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s like when I made that short with Rob Crystell.&nbsp;&nbsp;It won two festival prizes and still whenever you bring it up it&rsquo;s to talk about how I stuck you with the kids for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; And it was really three days, by the way.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Oh, Jesus Christ, Paul.&rdquo; 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well this thing we&rsquo;re doing Saturday is a SAG deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Micro-budget, but it&rsquo;s a union deal and the guy shooting it is the husband of a bona fide rock star ... so, biz trumps play-date with Big-Nose Sue,&rdquo; I said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She looked up at me, grim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay Paul, I guess you win,&rdquo; she said. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She stood up and walked over close, so she could be extra sure Sammy wouldn&rsquo;t hear. 
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But you can go fuck yourself anyway,&rdquo; she said. 
    </div>
</div>
