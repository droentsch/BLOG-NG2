        The Female Biology
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;There was a little more to it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean at the end?&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a comment.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Jesus,&nbsp;like a critique?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I sighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like a critique.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He pushed his coffee cup aside so he could gesture freely with his hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The first thing you have to do is learn
        to use the female biology to prolong sex.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;What about the vitamins and working out?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I’ll get to that,&nbsp;but see,&nbsp;no matter what shape you’re in you can always use the female biology to your advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Women
        can come a lot more than men.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s the basic fact you have to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Men orgasm and it’s like the train goes completely
        off the tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;A second ago you knew exactly where you were going and why and then there’s this big explosion and
        you find yourself lying on your side with some stupid television theme from when you were eight years old playing
        in your head.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He glanced around.&nbsp;&nbsp;He’d been talking pretty loud and I guess he thought people were listening in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Me,&nbsp;I couldn’t tell.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        He lowered his voice and leaned closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&nbsp;there are those weird occasions when you can go again almost immediately,
        like if you’re with somebody really hot and you haven’t had sex in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that’s quirky.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t count
        on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So just assume after you orgasm you’ll need a lot more time to recover than she will.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I’m not exactly sure that’s how it works,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean,&nbsp;it’s not like I’ve never had sex before.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s pretty much the
        same for men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;You slam for awhile,&nbsp;have a smoke and maybe a drink,&nbsp;and then maybe slam some more if you
        want to.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp said: &ldquo;That whole pattern is a cliché based on the male biology.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality,&nbsp;female orgasms don’t even have to be these
        big explosive moments.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be long,&nbsp;cascading rhythms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever hear of the hour-long orgasm?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It’s biology,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It’s evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;See,&nbsp;that trigger in your brain that fires when you orgasm?&nbsp;&nbsp;The trigger that says
        you can crawl away and die now?&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s probably been part of the male brain since before we were human.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we
        were just fish fucking in a prehistoric swamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Male salmon fucks,&nbsp;male salmon dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because nature’s done with
        him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay,&nbsp;cut to a billion years later and now we’re human males trying to score with actresses who frame their
        cunts at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t die after we fuck,&nbsp;but we definitely feel the curtain come down and the lights go out because
        nature says that when the man comes,&nbsp;his part in the process is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s done.&nbsp;&nbsp;He can move along.&nbsp;&nbsp;But chicks?&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
        part is just starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trigger doesn’t fire in their brains until you’re driving them to the hospital and they’re
        pounding you with their fists and screaming how they never want to see you again with your dick out.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So when a chick comes,&nbsp;if you didn’t rub her cunt raw,&nbsp;she’s ready to go again in a few minutes.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So… ?&rdquo; I asked.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;So when you fuck,&nbsp;make it about her orgasm for as long as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;See if you can make her come at least three times before
        you come once.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Three times!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You can do it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get one of those books on massive female orgasm,&nbsp;the cascading orgasm that lasts forever.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Now I’m supposed to go buy textbooks so I can learn to be some theatre slut’s clit-ninja and not come once?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Now people were definitely starting to notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl and this Asian guy in a ringer tee had the decency to put earbuds in
        and listen to their tunes,&nbsp;but this other guy in a pink tie and cheap business suit was giving us the eye over his
        newspaper.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Parp and I noticed the guy almost simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp jumped up,&nbsp;grabbed his coffee,&nbsp;and headed for the front door.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Let’s split,&rdquo; he muttered low as he walked past me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed him out.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pansy!&rdquo; I said when we were out on the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp just said: &ldquo;Using her biology is how you make it
        last.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rim her asshole while she’s getting ready to come again.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Without coming even once?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You’ll come already!&nbsp;&nbsp;Save it for last.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like dessert.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;But what if she starts sucking my cock?&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m supposed to say ‘stop’?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Whoa.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the look on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;You would be in total control if you could do that.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;I’m not sure I’m looking for total control.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well,&nbsp;you can get blown,&nbsp;just not all the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Back her off before you orgasm.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That’s bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who does that?&nbsp;&nbsp;You?&nbsp;&nbsp;You do that?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You can do it,&nbsp;too!&nbsp;&nbsp;But you need to practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Train yourself.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Train myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;For sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who trains for sex?&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s what comes naturally.&nbsp;&nbsp;They even wrote a song about it.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That song was written by two squares for a Broadway musical about rubes grabbing ass behind the barn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try not to make it
        your sexual manifesto.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        We crossed the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;He needed to use an ATM so we spent the next few minutes alone in the vestibule of some bank.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;It’s a physical activity,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to train for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to learn technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t take your dick out
        once a year and expect to perform like a porn star.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        That was a little harsh,&nbsp;but I didn’t say anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean,&nbsp;it pretty much described how I went into that night with Cammy,
        just sort of expecting I’d let Admiral Ballsy off the leash and he’d take a nice big bite out of the cute little
        snatch cowering in the corner.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But at least he didn’t dwell on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;he started giving me pointers.&nbsp;&nbsp;First,&nbsp;to get my dick up I had to do kegels.
        Man kegels.&nbsp;&nbsp;An excercise where you flex your dick over and over until it grows biceps.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Flexing my dick,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That really works?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Try it for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ll never go back.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then came the usual lecture on diet and exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;See,&nbsp;it isn’t enough for Parp to tell me the mechanical,&nbsp;logistical rules
        for getting a harder cock.&nbsp;&nbsp;No,&nbsp;he’s got to make it a lifestyle change,&nbsp;a part of my new identity.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        This insistence that people completely change their lives in order to reach any goal?&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an integral part of Parp’s personna.
        The part everyone laughs at most.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s what — more than anything else — puts the &ldquo;nutty&rdquo; in Parp nuttiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s
        like you need to lose a few pounds,&nbsp;so you ask Parp about it and he says first you have to go out and get this really
        expensive bat costume and get used to wearing it when you go out in spite of the looks you get on the street,&nbsp;and
        then you have to spend all your free time in a cave building gizmos for your utility belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;— You don’t have a utility
        belt?&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit,&nbsp;are you serious about losing weight or what?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You can’t change your life without changing your life,&rdquo; he said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I might have winced.
    </div>
