    <div class="body">
        It was around this time that the adventure started getting unpredictably complicated. &nbsp;I was obsessed with the
            pros and cons of becoming mini-Parp and yapping about said pros and cons with Jessica and Libby and letting the
            whole subject make me stand stock still in the middle of my shifts at the bar where I&rsquo;d stare off into
            space while customers fumed and Carrie nagged. &nbsp;And I was obsessed with the same pros and cons while I was
            walking down streets and trying to watch T.V. and trying even harder to sound cheerful in front of the wife.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then boom. &nbsp;Out of another corner of the universe &mdash; a corner I just didn&rsquo;t have my eye on at the
            moment &mdash; another pair of things emerged to demand my attention 
        <em>or else</em>
        .
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Or maybe I&rsquo;m just making it sound all grandiose because one of my connivances was about to catch up with me.
            &nbsp;Yeah. &nbsp;I guess it&rsquo;s possible I get more philosophical when somebody catches me in a big fat
            lie.
        
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, remember back when I said I&rsquo;d give Parp my acting paycheck &mdash; that paycheck from the first day shooting
        
        <em>Little Round Jewish Hat</em>
        &nbsp;&mdash; if he&rsquo;d make me a producer? &nbsp;And remember how he said &ldquo;good deal&rdquo; and I agreed
            to fork over? &nbsp;Well I never really cleared that with Junior. &nbsp;Because&hellip; &nbsp;I knew there was
            no way she&rsquo;d go for it. &nbsp;I mean lookit: I&rsquo;m an actor. &nbsp;I have a dayjob slinging suds. &nbsp;Why
            was I giving my paycheck to someone to let me produce something?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Was &ldquo;being a producer&rdquo; something that lit my fire all of a sudden? &nbsp;Was I dreaming up projects?
            &nbsp;Looking for properties? &nbsp;Attaching actors? &nbsp;Raising funds?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Of course not! &nbsp;Just thinking about it makes me want to swim to the bottom of a bottle of tequila and annihilate
            my last brain cell.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And Junior knew it, too. &nbsp;She knew I had no interest in the business end of the business. &nbsp;Plus, I told
            her already that I was a producer on 
        <em>Hat</em>
        &nbsp;because Parp begged me to help him and I couldn&rsquo;t turn him down. &nbsp;&mdash; So why did I owe him money
            now?
        
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But back when I promised Parp the check it just seemed like clearing it with Junior was one of those bridges I&rsquo;d
            cross when I got to it. &nbsp;Eventually.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then suddenly there it was. &nbsp;The bridge. &nbsp;Right in front of me.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I was actually a little surprised it only took a week for the check to make it to my mailbox, even though the day
            it came was the day I should have been expecting it on the official schedule. &nbsp;The ideal schedule. &nbsp;The
            schedule where all the gears mesh perfectly &mdash; the union gears, the production company gears, the payroll
            company gears. &nbsp;But at least one of those gears usually jams up in the real world. &nbsp;So I was thinking
            there could easily be an extra week of waiting before the check arrived.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And an extra week of waiting meant an extra week for me to relax before I had to look Junior in the eye and come
            up with an excuse.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        See, movie companies, even dinky little indy companies, hire payroll firms to handle all the withholdings for the
            government and the union. &nbsp;The movie company fills out paperwork and sends it to the payroll firm, the payroll
            firm cuts the checks and sends them to the union, and the union sends the checks to the actors.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I have no idea why it works that way.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        And like I said, usually all these parts moving means a delay of a day or two. &nbsp;At least. &nbsp;But not this
            time. &nbsp;This time I came in from walking the boys home from school one day and saw it sitting there on the
            kitchen counter, looking all innocent and business-like.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior was standing at the sink, where she always seems to be in my fantasy-enhanced memory of those days, doing
            dishes in fuck-me pumps and wearing tightish jeans on a roundish ass.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Her back was to me but still somehow she saw me see the check, because she said, &ldquo;Yep, came on time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m
            making some deposits tomorrow so I&rsquo;ll take it down then.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I thought about that for a sec. &nbsp;I suddenly had the sense of an impending confrontation. &nbsp;You know? &nbsp;Some
            people are okay with that. &nbsp;They even invite it. &nbsp;I hate confrontation so I was quiet for a few seconds
            while I leaned against the counter and pushed my glasses up on my nose.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Then suddenly I opened my mouth and heard these words come out: &ldquo;Better leave that one out, hon. &nbsp;I promised
            to sign it over to Parp.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I still can&rsquo;t believe I said that! &nbsp;What did I have, a death wish?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I barely finished saying &ldquo;Parp&rdquo; when she shouted, &ldquo;What?!!&rdquo; and spun around to look at me.
            &nbsp;She grabbed a tiny towel and dried her hands real fast like she needed them to strangle something.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Paulie are you &nbsp;freakin&rsquo; kidding me?!&rdquo; she yelped.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Babe, the kids!&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        The boys were in their room doing god-knows-what on the Internet, but still they were only a few steps away and the
            door to their room is pretty thin.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Junior got all whispery because I guess now we were both pretending that &ldquo;freaking&rdquo; was a grown-up word
            we couldn&rsquo;t let the boys hear us say. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you giving Tony freakin&rsquo; Parp our money?!&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I just stared at her face for a long time. &nbsp;I could feel my eyeballs scanning it. &nbsp;Scan left. &nbsp;Scan
            right. &nbsp;Scan left. &nbsp;Swear to god I could hear a little &ldquo;click&rdquo; each time they changed direction.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well, you know ...&rdquo; I finally said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a producer on this short.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;You mean after all the unpaid work you did, he&rsquo;s still demanding something financial? &nbsp;Something
            monetary?!&rdquo;
        
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Well &mdash; &rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;That night you helped him with the voice-overs. &nbsp;Unpaid! &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t get to be a producer for
            that? &nbsp;What time did you get in?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Um, not till next morning,&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, yeah, you and the boys were at church already&hellip;
            &nbsp;I guess I can see your point?&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She heard the impending &ldquo;but.&rdquo; &nbsp;The &ldquo;but&rdquo; I was about to say. &nbsp;The &ldquo;but&rdquo;
            that never got out of my mouth. &nbsp;She made a sound like a surprised little shriek and spun around and went
            back to doing the dishes. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s-your-check-do-whatever-the-fuck-you-want-with-it,&rdquo; she
            said.
        
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        Even though she was still all whispery she was able to machine-gun the words out so I&rsquo;d know she meant 
        <em>you fucking asshole you&rsquo;re beyond the reach of help!</em>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I turned around and went to the window and looked out at the market across Amsterdam Avenue. &nbsp;Some guy in a
            dirty white jacket was holding the door for people in exchange for their guilt about not giving him their change.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        &ldquo;Ya know what?&rdquo; I said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Deposit the check. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;Parp&rsquo;s
            got enough out of me for one production.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        She didn&rsquo;t say anything for a few seconds, just clattered a dish or two into the drainer. &nbsp;Then she said,
            &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; like she thought I might be a human being again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry Paulie, but it just makes
            me so mad sometimes the way you do and do and do and don&rsquo;t get any life of your own.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I gave her a hug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I get it, babe,&rdquo; I said.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But what I was thinking was that after the check was deposited and Junior had time to forget about it? &nbsp;I could
            ATM the cash in small amounts and pay Parp what I owed him. &nbsp; I mean, what I 
        <em>promised</em>
        &nbsp;
        him.
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        But then Junior went into the boys&rsquo; room to see what they were up to and I thought about it some more. &nbsp;She
            was right. &nbsp;That promise I made Parp? &nbsp;It was an extorted promise, wasn&rsquo;t it? &nbsp;And what
            about those extra two days on the set? &nbsp;What about going out to Long Island to pick up Belinda and showing
            that Skizz kid how to roll cable? &nbsp;That wasn&rsquo;t worth anything? &nbsp;Parp couldn&rsquo;t call me a
            producer in exchange for that?
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        I didn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I was tired and I had a shift to go to at the tavern. &nbsp;I decided to figure it out
            later.
