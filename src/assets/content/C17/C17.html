	<div class='body'>There are lots of takes and re-takes in movies. You probably know that already.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actors get into character, do
		some lines, stop, do them again until somebody says okay, fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the director is really nervous, it could
		be forever before the &ldquo;okay, fine&rdquo; comes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, said director is starting to get defensive
		because he can see production assistants rolling their eyes.</div>
	<div class='body'>The best way to keep that guy from turning a fun day into a nightmare of &ldquo;one more time&rdquo; is to have somebody
		standing close to him &ndash; the cinematographer or audio person or assistant director &ndash;say something like &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;
		after the fifth or sixth take.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know?&nbsp;&nbsp;A &ldquo;wow&rdquo; that says,
		<em>I&rsquo;ve seen this so many times I could puke but that last time through made me a believer again.</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>That&rsquo;s pretty much what the director is looking for anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Audience reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroking.
		Assurance.</div>
	<div class='body'>So all I&rsquo;m saying is, crew: Do you want to go home?&nbsp;&nbsp;The word is &ldquo;wow.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>See, there&rsquo;s no such thing as labor laws in movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, there are but nobody pays attention to them
		unless you&rsquo;re a kid, including the union.&nbsp;&nbsp;So twelve hours into your eight hour day you will start to have
		psychotic impulses. For example, moving in on Lenny&rsquo;s face means moving all the lights close, the camera close, then
		somebody says, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like the same light,&rdquo; and out come the bounce boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the
		cloth suspended in frames like sails, and these contraptions all sit in a four-foot square area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these
		boards go up by his face and they shoot.</div>
	<div class='body'>Again.&nbsp;&nbsp;And again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until somebody says, &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; and the director says, &ldquo;Okay, fine.&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Think about it the next time you see a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;See that shot on the desert island?&nbsp;&nbsp;Any shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantee
		you if the camera moved one foot to the right of the castaway you&rsquo;d see some sweaty guy in a Willy-Nelson get-up
		holding a big piece of cardboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you could read his mind?&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;d be a better than
		even chance you&rsquo;d get a visual of the director with a plastic fork in his eye.</div>
	<div class='body'>But the filmtards just do what they&rsquo;re told and keep their mouths shut, like the guys who dragged slabs for the pharaohs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
		what they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, for the rest of us it&rsquo;s just a butt-load of waiting and drinking coffee and not
		being at Chuck E.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheese.</div>
	<div class='body center'>****</div>
	<div class='body'>I thought I noticed some gratuitous squeezes on my arm when we were walking down the so-called &ldquo;Soho strip.&rdquo;
		&mdash; And I looked at Cammy and she gave me kind of a little smile and I gigcackled kind of quietly.</div>
	<div class='body'>(Oh yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Cunt&rsquo;s pal?&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name is
		<em>Cameron</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I call her Cammy now.)</div>
	<div class='body'>Of course, I wasn&rsquo;t sure right then that she was coming on to me, but I was hoping, in spite of the completely uncalled-for
		face she made at me when we first made eye contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, &ldquo;Is shit happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is she
		just acting?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>But the more I thought about it the more it seemed like shit must be happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why else would she be squeezing
		my forearm and pressing her ass cheek up against mine?&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay in &ldquo;character&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;It just
		didn&rsquo;t seem feasible.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I gigcackled softly some more and I thought about it.</div>
	<div class='body'>Then Bobby got the great idea to do a close-up of my famous &ldquo;nonplussed look&rdquo; &ndash; the one-take double take
		&ndash; when Lenny&rsquo;s yarmulke first goes flying off his head.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>(No, it&rsquo;s not in the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parp cut it out because he&rsquo;s a vindictive prick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Timing,&rdquo;
		he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The footage was running longer than the song so something had to go.&rdquo; What a wipe.)</div>
	<div class='body'>So suddenly I got to be the center of attention. For a long time, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember what I just got done saying about
		close-ups and people surrounding the actor and staring at him and making sure his light is just right for take after take
		after take? Well, that was me in the center of it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was all alone up there on the stage in front of the
		green screen with makeup whore patting my face and cameras and crew closing in.&nbsp;&nbsp;And best of all I got to show
		Cammy that I had wit.&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was urbane if not dashing.&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was a somebody, and not just a somebody
		with a day job rubbing glass mugs.</div>
	<div class='body'>At first, when Bobby said he wanted to get the close-up and everyone should get off the stage but me, I gigcackled self-deprecatingly
		and said, &ldquo;You sure you don&rsquo;t want Cameron up here?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Nope, just you,&rdquo; said Bobby.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause she&rsquo;s a lot prettier than I am.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>I looked at her as she was stepping off the stage when I said that.&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned around and gave me the smile that
		said I&rsquo;m such a sweetheart.</div>
	<div class='body'>I gigcackled again when I saw that.</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp and Whispers caught the exchange gave me the look that says,
		<em>Somebody&rsquo;s trying to put his penis in the blonde girl</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn&rsquo;t say anything.</div>
	<div class='body'>I had a great time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy guacamole.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like Noel Coward playing a Las Vegas lounge with a cigarette
		in one hand and a cocktail in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;In between takes while the crew was making adjustments, people kept
		lobbing softballs at me and I kept parking them and all the babes were laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Main Cunt laughed, but
		if
		<em>she</em> wanted a piece of this now after her last little tirade she was going to have to work for it.</div>
	<div class='body'>Ya know?</div>
	<div class='body'>For example Bobby said: &ldquo;Looking good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know you were getting a close-up?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And I said: &ldquo;Ah, so this is a &lsquo;close-up&rsquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think anyone will notice my eyes are in fact
		tattoos?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And somebody said: &ldquo;Would you move closer to the light?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And I said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll move closer, but if I see dead relatives and Jesus I&rsquo;m backing away again.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And Bang said: &ldquo;Hey Paul are you gay?&rdquo;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>And I said: &ldquo;Not even a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I were persuadable on that head I&rsquo;d fuck your brains out,
		sexypants.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And Parp said: &ldquo;Is this your Noel-Coward-playing-Las-Vegas routine?&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>And I said: &ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo;</div>
	<div class='body'>Really, I was on a roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;And like I said, chicks were laughing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like the time in dialects class
		when for my midterm I got up and read the first chapter of
		<em>Giles Goat-Boy
		</em> with a Scots accent.</div>
	<div class='body'>It killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can credit that performance with the blowjob I got a week later from Sela Krissman.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<em>It</em> killed.</div>
	<div class='body'>And up in the risers, facing the stage, there was Cammy, with her beautiful blonde hair and funny nose and round ass ...&nbsp;&nbsp;a
		babe who pumps iron to stay perfect, who refuses to allow her body to follow the implications of her unfixed nose.</div>
	<div class='body'>I could see her over the heads of the crew.</div>
	<div class='body'>At one point, during my rapid-fire exchange with the filmtards, she was standing and facing away from me, then turned around,
		caught me looking at her, sat down, opened her legs and grabbed her thighs so that her hands framed her cunt while she
		gave me the smile that said,
		<em>Want this cunt?</em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>Someone giggled and said &ldquo;Cameron!&rdquo; but she was far enough back in the risers that most people didn&rsquo;t
		see.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I looked away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; and he and Parp turned around for a minute to
		scan whatever it was I might have been looking at.&nbsp;&nbsp;But by then Cammy was yawning a great big exaggerated yawn.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>They didn&rsquo;t catch on.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;You okay, Paul?&rdquo; Parp asked.</div>
	<div class='body'>&ldquo;Yup, just ...&rdquo; I trailed off there, &ldquo;...&nbsp;&nbsp;distracted ...&rdquo; I said finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
		could only see Cammy with my peripheral vision but I&rsquo;m pretty sure she was smiling.</div>
	<div class='body'>Oh,
		<em>Cam</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s harsh remembering this.</div>
