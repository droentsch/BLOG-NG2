	<div class='body'>So I bit the bullet and put on my grunt
		hat.&#160; Hey, if it meant time in front of the camera later I was
		pretty sure it would all even out.&#160; People might see me dragging
		shit and think, &#8220;Oh, look at the crewtard.&#8221;&#160; But
		later when they saw me in front of the camera they&#8217;d say,
		&#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s the actor guy from Saturday.&#160; He&#8217;s
		funny!&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>Or something.</div>
	<div class='body'>I found the kid Vider was talking about and
		yeah, he was struggling with the cables.&#160; As I was walking over
		to him this other guy carrying a bunch of bounce-boards shouted to
		him:&#160; &#8220;Hey, Skizz, ya know it can&#8217;t hurt ya if it
		ain&#8217;t plugged in, right?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Yeah, fuck you,&#8221; the kid
		moaned.&#160; He looked so forlorn, all alone next to a big cardboard
		box filled up with big thick wires that wouldn&#8217;t unclump.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I got up to him I said:
		&#8220;Skizz?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>He said: &#8220;Charles.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>I said: &#8220;Oh.&#160; I&#8217;m Paul.&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>He laughed this snide little laugh.&#160;
		&#8220;Yuh-huh,&#8221; he said.</div>
	<div class='body'>He looked like an overfed goat.&#160; He was
		chunky and blonde &#8212; curly, blonde ringlets under a Red Sox
		baseball cap and a big fat baby face with whispy little whiskers.</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;There&#8217;s a trick to that,&#8221; I
		said.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&#8220;I <em>know</em>.&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Here, lemme show ya.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>He gave me the cable.&#160; I showed him.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		&#8220;Um, wait a minute,&#8221; he said.&#160; His left eye wandered
		a little making him look vaguely insane.&#160; &#8220;That isn&#8217;t
		the way <em>Mike</em> says to do it.&#160; Mike says go
		over-under.&#8221;
	</div>
	<div class='body'>He said that in a really loud voice so a split
		second later crewtard number two steps over and says,
		&#8220;What&#8217;s up guys?&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;This guy says wind the cable switching
		hands.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>So suddenly I&#8217;m fighting with two
		twenty-somethings about the right way to wind cable like it was the
		right way to suture brain.&#160; That and a sudden craving for
		nicotine made me want to bite through my own cheek.</div>
	<div class='body'>It was getting a little too loud when Parp
		shouts from across the room: &#8220;Hey hey hey...What the
		fuck?!&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;This guy is telling Skizz to wind the
		cable wrong!&#8221; Mike screamed like a girl.&#160; I just rolled my
		eyes.&#160; I could see the cigarette pack sticking out of my pocket
		on the table where I&#8217;d thrown my jacket.</div>
	<div class='body'>Parp didn&#8217;t even look up from what he was
		doing &#8212; which was helping to drag a large metal cabinet across
		the floor.&#160; &#8220;Paul&#8217;s a producer on this
		project,&#8221; he shouted really loud.&#160; &#8220;Do it his
		way.&#8221;</div>
	<div class='body'>When Whispers &#8212; who was standing on a
		ladder focusing a light &#8212; heard Parp say that he erupted in
		laughter and did that annoying slow-clap of his with the hands cupped
		so they&#8217;d boom.</div>
	<div class='body'>But Parp didn&#8217;t crack a smile and no one
		else but Whispers thought he was yanking me.</div>
	<div class='body'>Mike turned on his heel and stomped away and
		Skizz handed me the cable.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		For two minutes I completely forgot about wanting a cigarette while I
		showed goat-boy how to wrap cable like a mensch.&#160; When I handed
		it back to him I looked to my left and there was Cammy in her brown
		NYU tee under an unbuttoned pink-pinstripe man-shirt.&#160; She had
		the low-rise jeans.&#160; And the brown half-boots that pushed her ass
		nice and up.&#160; I winked at her suavely and went for my cigarettes.
		<em>Yeah</em>, my stride said.&#160; <em>Producer on the set</em>.
	</div>
	<div class='body'>&#8220;Be right back,&#8221; I said in the
		mature voice while I walked to the door and dug the lighter out of my
		pocket.</div>
	<div class='body'>When I hit the street I half expected to turn
		around and see Cammy following me.&#160; &#8212; But she wasn&#8217;t,
		the little twat.&#160; I hate being left alone when other people are
		around &#8212; it&#8217;s too much like getting a table for one in a
		busy restaurant &#8212; but this time it gave me a chance to think
		while I sucked smoke.&#160; And what I thought about was how Parp had
		just taken the sting out of the day for me.&#160; Just by yelling out
		what he yelled out.&#160; Now I could do any humiliating manual task
		on the menu and people would know I was just this producer who
		wasn&#8217;t afraid to pitch in.</div>
	<div class='body'>And on top of that Vider was going to get me
		into one of the upcoming shots.</div>
	<div class='body'>
		<em>Yep</em> , I thought.&#160; <em>It&#8217;s all locking in</em>.<em></em>
	</div>
	<div class='body'>I stubbed out the half-smoked cigarette and
		went back in the door to Vider&#8217;s.&#160; I knew exactly which
		card to play now.</div>
</div>
